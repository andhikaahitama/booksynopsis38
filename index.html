Paperback, brief, and inexpensive, each interpretative biography in this series focuses on a figure whose actions and ideas significantly influenced the course of American history and national life. At the same time, each biography relates the life of its subject to the broader themes and developments of the times.</p></p><p></p><h2>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Mark Twain Library)</h2><p>This is the first edition of <i>Huckleberry Finn </i>ever to be based on Mark Twain's entire original manuscript&#x2014;including its first 663 pages, which had been lost for more than a hundred years when they were discovered in 1990 in a Los Angeles attic. The text of the Mark Twain Library edition (first published in 1985) has been re-edited using this manuscript, restoring thousands of details of wording, spelling, and punctuation that had been corrupted by Mark Twain's typist, typesetters, and proofreaders. The revised Mark Twain Library <i>Huckleberry Finn </i>is sure to become the standard edition for all students and readers of Mark Twain.<br><br>The authoritative new edition of this beloved work includes all of the 174 first-edition illustrations by Edward Windsor Kemble, which the author called "rattling good." It also contains a new gathering of manuscript pages, photographically reproduced, and an appendix of passages from the manuscript, including the long-lost "ghost story," which illustrate how extensively Mark Twain revised his work. The editors have also revised and updated their explanatory notes, the maps of the Mississippi River valley, and the glossary of slang and dialect words.<br><br>The story of Huck and his companion Jim, a runaway slave, as they travel down the Mississippi to escape from slavery and "sivilization" has been delighting readers around the world since Twain first published it in 1885. Simply put, it is a masterpiece: revolutionary in its narrative method, surpassingly funny, and at the same time deeply perceptive about human nature. No other American novel of the nineteenth century still commands so vast an audience, and certainly no other retains the capacity to stir controversy with its sharp satire on American racism.<br><br><b>A Responsible Critical Text</b><br><br>To produce this authoritative critical text, the editors studied all aspects of Mark Twain's manuscript, working notes, proof sheets, and letters. To judge the authority of every variant, they created a unique electronic database that made it possible to analyze--by speaker and date of composition--every word in the manuscript and first edition.<br><br><b>An Inside View of How Mark Twain Wrote Huckleberry Finn</b><br><br>The new appendixes of "Three Passages" and "Manuscript Facsimiles" will give teachers and students as well as the general reader a close-up view of Mark Twain's writing process. They can follow the evolution of three key passages, as the author searched for the right word, the truest dialect, and the most telling description.</p><p>A seminal work of American Literature that still commands deep praise and still elicits controversy, <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> is essential to the understanding of the American soul. The recent discovery of the first half of Twain's manuscript, long thought lost, made front-page news. And this unprecedented edition, which contains for the first time omitted episodes and other variations present in the first half of the handwritten manuscript, as well as facsimile reproductions of thirty manuscript pages, is indispensable to a full understanding of the novel. The changes, deletions, and additions made in the first half of the manuscript indicate that Mark Twain frequently checked his impulse to write an even darker, more confrontational book than the one he finally published.Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

But the trend is clear: clients and consumers alike want control over their health care choices, making the time ripe for a practical resource that guides both the clinician and the consumer on complementary and alternative medicine (CAM).<br><br> This book answers that call. Three noted experts in integrative medicine, Drs. Brown, Gerbarg, and Muskin, demystify the complexities of alternative mental health care, giving readers a comprehensive yet accessible guidebook to the best treatment options out there.<br><br> From mood, memory, and anxiety disorders to ADD, sexual enhancement issues, psychotic disorders, and substance abuse, every chapter covers a major diagnostic category. The authors then present a range of complementary and alternative treatments&#x2015;including the use of herbs, nutrients, vitamins, nootropics, hormones, and mind-body practices&#x2015; that they have found to be beneficial for various conditions within each category. For example, B complex vitamins and folate have been shown to help with depression; omega-3 fatty acids can offer relief for bipolar sufferers; coherent and resonant breathing techniques&#x2015;used by Buddhist monks&#x2015;induce healthy alpha rhythms in the brain to relieve anxiety; the elderly can boost their memory by taking the ancient medicinal herb Rhodiola rosea; and those with chronic fatigue syndrome can find comfort in acupuncture and yoga. Focusing on evidence-based approaches, the research, the authors&#x2019; clinical experience, and the potential risks and benefits of each treatment are carefully examined.<br><br> Brown, Gerbarg, and Muskin have distilled an otherwise daunting field of treatment down to its basics: their overriding approach is to present the CAM methods that are most practical in a clinical setting, easy to administer, and low in side effects. With helpful summary tables at the end of each chapter, clinical pearls, and case vignettes interspersed throughout, this is a must-have resource for all clinicians and consumers who want the best that alternative medicine has to offer.</p><p><p><strong>Richard P.

In this original and provocative account of the evolutionary origins of human communication, Michael Tomasello connects the fundamentally cooperative structure of human communication (initially discovered by Paul Grice) to the especially cooperative structure of human (as opposed to other primate) social interaction. Tomasello argues that human cooperative communication rests on a psychological infrastructure of shared intentionality (joint attention, common ground), evolved originally for collaboration and culture more generally. The basic motives of the infrastructure are helping and sharing: humans communicate to request help, inform others of things helpfully, and share attitudes as a way of bonding within the cultural group. These cooperative motives each created different functional pressures for conventionalizing grammatical constructions. Requesting help in the immediate you-and-me and here-and-now, for example, required very little grammar, but informing and sharing required increasingly complex grammatical devices. Drawing on empirical research into gestural and vocal communication by great apes and human infants (much of it conducted by his own research team), Tomasello argues further that humans' cooperative communication emerged first in the natural gestures of pointing and pantomiming. Conventional communication, first gestural and then vocal, evolved only after humans already possessed these natural gestures and their shared intentionality infrastructure along with skills of cultural learning for creating and passing along jointly understood communicative conventions. Challenging the Chomskian view that linguistic knowledge is innate, Tomasello proposes instead that the most fundamental aspects of uniquely human communication are biological adaptations for cooperative social interaction in general and that the purely linguistic dimensions of human communication are cultural conventions and constructions created by and passed along within particular cultural groups.</p></p><p>Michael Tomasello is Codirector of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig. He is the author of <i>The Cultural Origins of Human Cognition</i> and <i>Constructing a Language: A Usage-Based Theory of Language Acquisition.</i>"Underscoring the uniqueness of humans is all too easy. The challenge is to explain it in a naturalistic perspective. Michael Tomasello meets the challenge with his unique suite of competencies in animal and human psychology, and his ability to think and write with clarity and insight about complex issues. There is much to learn and much to think and also to argue about in this important book."<br> &#x2014;<b>Dan Sperber</b>, Institut Jean Nicod</p><h2>The Rainbow Bible (Childrens 603N)</h2><p>This popular children's Bible in a classic binding for children ages 4-10 features a 32-page article by Charles C.

The Qin and Han empires represent the &#x201c;classical&#x201d; era of Chinese civilization, coinciding in both importance and timing with the Greco-Roman period in the West. Under the short-lived Qin and centuries-long Han, warring principalities were united under a common emperor, creating not only political and intellectual institutions but also the foundation for a Chinese art, culture, and national identity that lasted over two millennia.&nbsp; Over 150 works from across the full breadth of Chinese artistic and decorative media-- including ceramics, metalwork, textiles, armor, sculpture, and jewelry &#x2013; are featured in this book and attest to the unprecedented role of art in ancient Chinese culture.

Now, in <em>The Plundered Planet</em>, Collier builds upon his renowned work on developing countries and the world's poorest populations to confront the global mismanagement of natural resources. <br><br> Proper stewardship of natural assets and liabilities is a matter of planetary urgency: natural resources have the potential either to transform the poorest countries or to tear them apart, while the carbon emissions and agricultural follies of the developed world could further impoverish them. <em>The Plundered Planet</em> charts a course between unchecked profiteering on the one hand and environmental romanticism on the other to offer realistic and sustainable solutions to dauntingly complex issues.<br><br>Grounded in a belief in the power of informed citizens, Collier proposes a series of international standards that would help poor countries rich in natural assets better manage those resources, policy changes that would raise world food supply, and a clear-headed approach to climate change that acknowledges the benefits of industrialization while addressing the need for alternatives to carbon trading. Revealing how all of these forces interconnect, <em>The Plundered Planet</em> charts a way forward to avoid the mismanagement of the natural world that threatens our future.<br></p><p><br><strong>Paul Collier</strong> is Professor of Economics and Director of the Center for the Study of African Economies at Oxford University and a former director of Development Research at the World Bank.

In The Plundered Planet, Collier tackles some of the most difficult questions of our time, and offers an insightful framework for effectively managing our world's natural resources.

Although the authors of <i>School Reform Critics</i> do not abandon their own ideas about the need for progressive changes in K&#x2013;12 schooling, they critique in specific ways the current so-called school reform movement, focusing on education in a democracy, context and policy implications, teachers and teacher education, and diversity and social justice. Their insightful chapters make a major contribution to our thoughtful consideration of where we are headed and in what direction we should be going if we seek to advance the public good, ensure a stronger democracy, and create more academically meaningful and equitable schools for all children.

Rather than &#x2018;leaving no child behind&#x2019;, current reforms have in fact made the situation worse, particularly for the most vulnerable students; and rather than &#x2018;racing to the top&#x2019;, current reforms are leading us down the wrong path. With a distinguished group of contributors and under the able editorship of Joseph L. DeVitis and Kenneth Teitelbaum, this volume examines the meaning, goals, and results of the neoconservative agenda and proposes a more promising approach for the future of public education. <i>School Reform Critics</i> is certain to make a substantial contribution to the conversation on school reform, standardization, and democracy.� (Sonia Nieto, Professor Emerita, Language, Literacy, and Culture, University of Massachusetts Amherst)<br> �&#x2018;School Reform Critics&#x2019; is exactly the kind of book that critically and democratically engaged educators need at this moment.

What does it mean to wear Gap or Gaultier, Milletts or Moschino? Are there any real differences between Hip-Hop style and Punk anti-styles? In this fully revised and updated edition, Malcolm Barnard introduces fashion and clothing as ways of communicating and challenging class, gender, sexual and social identities.<br>Drawing on a range of theoretical approaches from Barthes and Baudrillard to Marxist, psychoanalytic and feminist theory, Barnard addresses the ambivalent status of fashion in contemporary culture.</p><p>Malcolm Barnard is at the School of Art and Design at the University of Derby.

The author examines the major influences on African culture and art over the centuries: the civilizations of Egypt and the Mediterranean coast, the spread of Islam, the Bantu migrations, the evolution of the tribal system, the arrival of the Europeans and Christianity and the development of trade within Africa and beyond. He then examines the earliest known art forms, the preshitoric rock art found in a number of regions and the artefacts of the ancient Nubian, Aksumite and Nok cultures, and goes on to consider the development of the visual arts in a number of individual regions ranging from the Sahara to the Cape, from Ethiopia and the Swahili coast in the east to the Niger Delta and Benin in the west.</p><p></p><h2>Promised Land, Crusader State: The American Encounter With the World Since 1776</h2><p>A look at America&#39;s foreign policy over the past two hundred years posits the theory that America is struggling with two visions of itself as reflected in its foreign policy</p><p>When the Cold War ended and left the United States without one clear, monolithic enemy or ideology to battle, a hint of confusion and indecisiveness entered U.S. foreign policy, revealing weaknesses in the American diplomatic tradition. However, According to Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Walter A. McDougall, this confusion was not a result of the Cold War, but rather made more visible by the absence of a looming conflict. Reaching back to 1776 to analyze the foreign policy decisions made during the U.S. progression to superpower, McDougall reveals the numerous paradoxes present in American foreign policy. <p> Beginning with the original intentions of the Founding Fathers and the various interpretations of those ideals over the years, he deconstructs the role of the U.S. in global affairs, questioning both the logic and motives of how the nation deals with friend and foe. One of McDougall's major contentions centers on efforts to affect other countries' policies and governments by projecting U.S. standards or choices on them. He is particularly concerned with what he views as an overextension of resources and wisdom, and the glaring hypocrisy such efforts reveal. He points to several examples of how time and energy was wasted trying to change those who were uninterested or unwilling. As McDougall points out lucidly and convincingly in <i>Promised Land, Crusader State: The American Encounter With the World Since 1776</i>, one nation cannot cure the major ills of another, and the price of such an attempt is too great to risk.</p>Walter A. McDougall received the Pulitzer Prize in history in 1986.

Harrowed by what he witnessed, he captured the scene in sketches that he would later develop into a series of illustrations and paintings, including the culminating painting, <i>Slaves Waiting for Sale, Richmond, Virginia</i>.</p>This innovative book uses Crowe&#x2019;s paintings to explore the texture of the slave trade in Richmond, Charleston, and New Orleans, the evolving iconography of abolitionist art, and the role of visual culture in the transatlantic world of abolitionism. Tracing Crowe&#x2019;s trajectory from Richmond across the American South and back to London&#x2014;where his paintings were exhibited just a few weeks after the start of the Civil War&#x2014;Maurie D. McInnis illuminates not only how his abolitionist art was inspired and made, but also how it influenced the international public&#x2019;s grasp of slavery in America. With almost 140 illustrations, <i>Slaves Waiting for Sale</i> brings a fresh perspective to the American slave trade and abolitionism as we enter the sesquicentennial of the Civil War.</p><p><b>Maurie D.

It is canny in its structure, astonishing in the depth of its research, and immensely sophisticated in the deployment of research details&#x2014;all in the service of a deeply rewarding argument. Using Crowe&#x2019;s painting as the backbone of the book is very smart, and the sequence of chapters, as McInnis charts the landscape of slavery from Richmond to Charleston to New Orleans, and the resulting visual representation of that landscape, is engrossing.

Even so, many of us believe that propaganda and manipulation aren't problems for us&#x2015;not in the way they were for the totalitarian societies of the mid-twentieth century. In <i>How Propaganda Works</i>, Jason Stanley demonstrates that more attention needs to be paid. He examines how propaganda operates subtly, how it undermines democracy&#x2015;particularly the ideals of democratic deliberation and equality&#x2015;and how it has damaged democracies of the past.</p><p>Focusing on the shortcomings of liberal democratic states, Stanley provides a historically grounded introduction to democratic political theory as a window into the misuse of democratic vocabulary for propaganda's selfish purposes. He lays out historical examples, such as the restructuring of the US public school system at the turn of the twentieth century, to explore how the language of democracy is sometimes used to mask an undemocratic reality. Drawing from a range of sources, including feminist theory, critical race theory, epistemology, formal semantics, educational theory, and social and cognitive psychology, he explains how the manipulative and hypocritical declaration of flawed beliefs and ideologies arises from and perpetuates inequalities in society, such as the racial injustices that commonly occur in the United States.</p><p><i>How Propaganda Works</i> shows that an understanding of propaganda and its mechanisms is essential for the preservation and protection of liberal democracies everywhere.</p></p><p><p>"Jason Stanley's <i>How Propaganda Works</i> is a novel and significant contribution that should revitalize political philosophy."<b>--Noam Chomsky</b></p><p>"Filled with compelling examples, this book examines what propaganda is and what threat bad propaganda poses for democracy.

A <i>repetition</i> and <i>examples first</i> approach introduces learners to mathematical rigor and abstraction while teaching them the basic notions and results of modern algebra. <b> </b> Chapter topics include group theory, direct products and Abelian groups, rings and fields, geometric constructions, historical notes, symmetries, and coding theory. <b> </b> For future teachers of algebra and geometry at the high school level. </p></p><p><p> This book aims to provide thorough coverage of the main topics of abstract algebra while remaining accessible to students with little or no previous exposure to abstract mathematics. It can be used either for a one-semester introductory course on groups and rings or for a full-year course. More specifics on possible course plans using the book are given in this preface. </p> <p><b>Style of Presentation</b></p> <p> Over many years of teaching abstract algebra to mixed groups of undergraduates, including mathematics majors, mathematics education majors, and computer science majors, I have become increasingly aware of the difficulties students encounter making their first acquaintance with abstract mathematics through the study of algebra. This book, based on my lecture notes, incorporates the ideas I have developed over years of teaching experience on how best to introduce students to mathematical rigor and abstraction while at the same time teaching them the basic notions and results of modern algebra. </p> <p> Two features of the teaching style I have found effective are <i>repetition</i> and especially an <i>examples first, definitions later</i> order of presentation. In this book, as in my lecturing, the hard conceptual steps are always prepared for by working out concrete examples first, before taking up rigorous definitions and abstract proofs. Absorption of abstract concepts and arguments is always facilitated by first building up the student's intuition through experience with specific cases. </p> <p> Another principle that is adhered to consistently throughout the main body of the book (Parts A and B) is that every algebraic theorem mentioned is given either with a complete proof, or with a proof broken up into to steps that the student can easily fill in, without recourse to outside references. The book aims to provide a self-contained treatment of the main topics of algebra, introducing them in such a way that the student can follow the arguments of a proof without needing to turn to other works for help. </p> <p> Throughout the book all the examples, definitions, and theorems are consecutively numbered in order to make locating any particular item easier for the reader. </p> <p><b>Coverage of Topics</b></p> <p> In order to accommodate students of varying mathematical, backgrounds, an optional Chapter 0, at the beginning, collects basic material used in the development of the main theories of algebra. Included are, among other topics, equivalence relations, the binomial theorem, De Moivre's formula for complex numbers, and the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. This chapter can be included as part of an introductory course or simply referred to as needed in later chapters. </p> <p> Special effort is made in Chapter 1 to introduce at the beginning all main types of groups the student will be working with in later chapters. The first section of the chapter emphasizes the fact that concrete examples of groups come from different sources, such as geometry, number theory, and the theory of equations. </p> <p> Chapter 2 introduces the notion of group homomorphism first and then proceeds to the study of normal subgroups and quotient groups. Studying the properties of the kernel of a homomorphism before introducing the definition of a normal subgroup makes the latter notion less mysterious for the student and easier to absorb and appreciate. A similar order of exposition is adopted in connection with rings. After the basic notion of a ring is introduced in Chapter 6, Chapter 7 begins with ring homomorphisms, after which consideration of the properties of the kernels of such homomorphisms gives rise naturally to the notion of an ideal in a ring. </p> <p> Each chapter is designed around some central unifying theme. For instance, in Chapter 4 the concept of group action is used to unify such results as Cayley's theorem, Burnside's counting formula, the simplicy of A5, and the Sylow theorems and their applications. </p> <p> The ring of polynomials over a field is the central topic of Part B, Rings and Fields, and is given a full chapter of its own, Chapter 8. The traditional main topic in algebra, the solution of polynomial equations, is emphasized. The solutions of cubics and quartics are introduced in Chapter 8. In Chapter 9 Euclidean domains and unique factorization domains are studied, with a section devoted to the Gaussian integers. The fundamental theorem of algebra is stated in Chapter 10. In Chapter 11 the connection among solutions of quadratic, cubic, and quartic polynomial equations and geometric constructions is explored. </p> <p> In Chapter 12, after Galois theory is developed, it is applied to give a deeper understanding of all these topics. For instance, the possible Galois groups of cubic and quartic polynomials are fully worked out, and Artin's Galois-theoretic proof of the fundamental- theorem of algebra, using nothing from analysis but the intermediate value theorem, is presented. The chapter, and with it the main body of the book, culminates in the proof of the insolubility of the general quintic and the construction of specific examples of quintics that are not solvable by radicals. </p> <p> A brief history of algebra is given in Chapter 13, after Galois theory (which was the main historical source of the group concept) has been treated, thus making a more meaningful discussion of the evolution of the subject possible. </p> <p> A collection of additional topics, several of them computational, is provided in Part C. In contrast to the main body of the book (Parts A and B), where completeness is the goal, the aim in Part C is to give the student an introduction to&#x2014;and some taste of&#x2014;a topic, after which a list of further references is provided for those who wish to learn more. Instructors may include as much or as little of the material on a given topic as time and inclination indicate. </p> <p> Each chapter in the book is divided into sections, and each section provided with a set of exercises, beginning with the more computational and proceeding to the more theoretical. Some of the theoretical exercises give a first introduction to topics that will be treated in more detail later in the book, while others introduce supplementary topic not otherwise covered, such as Cayley digraphs, formal power series, and the existence of transcendental numbers. </p> <p><b>Suggestions for Use</b></p> <p> A one-semester introductory course on groups and rings might include Chapter 0 (optional); Chapters 1, 2, and 3 on groups; and Chapters 6, 7, and 8 on rings. </p> <p> For a full-year course, Parts A and B, Chapters 1 through 12, offer a comprehensive treatment of the subject. Chapter 9, on Euclidean domains, and Chapter 11, on geometric constructions, can be treated as optional supplementary topics, depending on time arid the interest of the students and the instructor. </p> <p> An instructor's manual, with solutions to all exercises plus further comments and suggestions, is available. Instructors can obtain it by directly contacting the publisher, Prentice Hall. </p> <p><b>Acknowledgments</b></p> <p> It is a pleasure to acknowledge various contributors to the development of this book.

Hennessy</b> is the president of Stanford University, where he has been a member of the faculty since 1977 in the departments of electrical engineering and computer science. Hennessy is a fellow of the IEEE and the ACM, a member of the National Academy of Engineering, the National Academy of Science, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the Spanish Royal Academy of Engineering. He received the 2001 Eckert-Mauchly Award for his contributions to RISC technology, the 2001 Seymour Cray Computer Engineering Award, and shared the John von Neumann award in 2000 with David Patterson. After completing the project in 1984, he took a one-year leave from the university to co-found MIPS Computer Systems, which developed one of the first commercial RISC microprocessors. After being acquired by Silicon Graphics in 1991, MIPS Technologies became an independent company in 1998, focusing on microprocessors for the embedded marketplace. As of 2004, over 300 million MIPS microprocessors have been shipped in devices ranging from video games and palmtop computers to laser printers and network switches. Hennessy's more recent research at Stanford focuses on the area of designing and exploiting multiprocessors. He helped lead the design of the DASH multiprocessor architecture, the first distributed shared-memory multiprocessors supporting cache coherency, and the basis for several commercial multiprocessor designs, including the Silicon Graphics Origin multiprocessors. Since becoming president of Stanford, revising and updating this text and the more advanced Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach has become a primary form of recreation and relaxation.</p><p></p><p><b>David A. Patterson</b> was the first in his family to graduate from college (1969 A.B UCLA), and he enjoyed it so much that he didn't stop until a PhD, (1976 UCLA). After 4 years developing a wafer-scale computer at Hughes Aircraft, he joined U.C. Berkeley in 1977. He spent 1979 at DEC working on the VAX minicomputer. He and colleagues later developed the Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC). By joining forces with IBM's 801 and Stanford's MIPS projects, RISC became widespread. In 1984 Sun Microsystems recruited him to start the SPARC architecture. In 1987, Patterson and colleagues wondered if tried building dependable storage systems from the new PC disks. This led to the popular Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID). He spent 1989 working on the CM-5 supercomputer. Patterson and colleagues later tried building a supercomputer using standard desktop computers and switches. The resulting Network of Workstations (NOW) project led to cluster technology used by many startups. He is now working on the Recovery Oriented Computing (ROC) project. In the past, he served as Chair of Berkeley's CS Division, Chair and CRA. He is currently serving on the IT advisory committee to the U.S. President and has just been elected President of the ACM. All this resulted in 150 papers, 5 books, and the following honors, some shared with friends: election to the National Academy of Engineering; from the University of California: Outstanding Alumnus Award (UCLA Computer Science Department), McEntyre Award for Excellence in Teaching (Berkeley Computer Science), Distinguished Teaching Award (Berkeley); from ACM: fellow, SIGMOD Test of Time Award, Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award; from IEEE: fellow, Johnson Information Storage Award, Undergraduate Teaching Award, Mulligan Education Medal, and von Neumann Medal.</p><p></p></p><h2>Painless Chemistry (Painless Series)</h2><p>Titles in Barron's extensive <i>Painless Series </i> cover a wide range of subjects as they are taught on middle school and high school levels.

As Ramsay tells his story, it begins to seem that from boyhood, he has exerted a perhaps mystical, perhaps pernicious, influence on those around him. His apparently innocent involvement in such innocuous events as the throwing of a snowball or the teaching of card tricks to a small boy in the end prove neither innocent nor innocuous. Fifth Business stands alone as a remarkable story told by a rational man who discovers that the marvelous is only another aspect of the real.</p><p><b><i>Fifth Business</i> Reading Group Guide:</b> <br><br> <b>INTRODUCTION</b><br> "We move through a throng of Sleeping Princesses, Belles Dames sans merci, Cinderellas, Wicked Witches, Powerful Wizards, Frog Princes, Lucky Third Sons, Ogres, Dwarves, Sagacious Animal Helpers and Servers, yes and Heroes and Heroines, in a world that is nothing less than an enchanted landscape."<br> Robertson Davies <p> Myth, magic, and miracles, freaks, saints, and devils--such is the world of wonders unleashed by a simple snowball thrown in the village of Deptford in 1908. </p><p> <b>Fifth Business</b> is Davies's masterwork, the book that cemented his reputation as one of the great storytellers of our time. When the book appeared in 1970, he had already published the three books of his <b>Salterton Trilogy</b>, which won him recognition in his native Canada as an incisive cultural critic and an endlessly entertaining novelist. He had struck a note near Mark Twain in his portrayal of small-town culture, satirizing the residents' pious absurdities without seeming cruel, dramatizing their dreams and good intentions without becoming sentimental. </p><p> With <b>Fifth Business</b>, he plumbed new artistic and spiritual depths. The opening scene, which he envisioned taking place at his boyhood home in Thamesville, Ontario, haunted Davies from the first time it appeared to him in about 1960 until he began to draft the novel ten years later: "It was simply a scene that kept occurring in my mind, which was of two boys on a village street on a winter night--I knew from the look of the atmosphere that it must be just around Christmas-time--and one boy threw a snowball at the other boy. Well, that was all there was to it, but it came so often and was so insistent that I had to ask myself, Why is that boy doing that and what is behind this and what is going on?" </p><p> Many elements of the novel that emerged from this vision were drawn from Davies's early childhood. Like Dunstable Ramsay's father, Davies's father was the one-man publisher of a village newspaper, and Davies grew up in the newspaper business. "In a newspaper family," he said, "you learn not only all the news that's fit to print, but all the news that is not fit to print, and you acquire an insight into human nature and the essence of a community which is very hard to acquire . . . in any other way." </p><p> Like his protagonist in <b>Fifth Business</b>, Davies was raised in the Presbyterian Church. Although he eventually rejected its particular doctrines, he retained a strongly religious temperament. His spiritual explorations ultimately found resonance in the works of Carl Gustav Jung. "Orthodox Christianity has always had for me the difficulty that it really won't come . . . to grips with the problem of evil," Davies said. "What looks good can be pushed to the point that it becomes evil, and . . . evil very frequently bears what can only be regarded as good fruit." Jung had portrayed God as a psychological reality that embraced polarities of good and evil, light and shadow; the devil is an inextricable part of him. One had to confront this shadow face-to-face in order to live a moral life. "The devil is the unexamined side of life," Davies said, "and the great evils spring from acting without knowledge of your subconscious intentions." </p><p> Davies was also drawn to Jung's deities because they had womanly as well as manly faces, faces that are reflected in his portrayal of Mary Dempster. Here were the feminine elements he found woefully lacking in Christianity, with its focus on God the Father and the Son. In Jung's landscape of the psyche, Davies found a theoretical grounding for the diverse representations of human quest and conflict he had come to appreciate. Beyond the Judeo-Christian literary tradition was a rich world of folk tales, myths, ghost stories, and legends that were sacred in their own way, striking deep spiritual chords in our unconscious. From this same sensibility sprang Davies's lifelong interest in saints, which he, like Ramsay, appreciated not as narrowly defined religious figures, but as archetypes of universal characters and tales. </p><p> The remarkable events that unfold in this "enchanted landscape" owe much to Davies's lifelong love of the theater. From boyhood he was drawn to the traveling circus, the magic show, and the movie palace. Over the course of his career he worked for the Old Vic Repertory Company in London, wrote a dozen plays, and was one of the founders of the Stratford Shakespeare Festival. His passion for theater was so intense that his novels have sometimes been criticized for their theatricality: How does Ramsay just happen to meet Paul Dempster repeatedly in his travels, and how does Surgeoner "randomly" pick Ramsay from the crowd at Colborne College? But such theatrical events--call them coincidence or fate--lie at the heart of Davies's worldview. "I'm not in any way a devotee of realism," said Davies, "and the theatre is never realistic, even when it's pretending to be intensely so." The meaningful stories in our lives are dramatic rather than naturalistic, remarkable rather than random. </p><p> This appreciation of the theater of the inner life could come only with age. Davies was in his fifties when he explored these demons of youth in <b>Fifth Business</b>, and the result is a captivating narrative stance. While working on the manuscript, he wrote, "It is autobiographical, but not as young men would do it; it will be rather as Dickens wrote <b>David Copperfield</b>--a fictional reworking of some things experienced and much rearranged--a spiritual autobiography in fact, and not a sweating account of the first time I backed a girl into a corner." Davies's protagonist frequently distances himself from immediate events, adding the tincture of age and humor to vividly recalled experience. </p><p>The unforgettable tone that arises from this perspective has been characterized as a hybrid of satire and romance. Davies somehow manages to marry these seemingly incompatible viewpoints, delighting in his own former naivet� and the follies of his youth while maintaining a fundamental earnestness about Ramsay's aspirations. It is the voice of a man at mid-life who has taken unusual paths, who is fascinated by the possibilities that lie before him, and who has lost neither his youthful seriousness nor his sense of humor. </p><p> Despite his established reputation in Canada, Davies was little known to U.S. readers and reviewers when <b>Fifth Business</b> was published in 1970. The American reception was exuberant, propelling the novel to bestseller lists in both the U.S. and Canada. Christopher Lehmann-Haupt described it in the <b>New York Times</b> as "a marvelously enigmatic novel . . . elegantly written and driven by irresistible narrative. One thinks of <b>The Magic Mountain</b> and <b>The French Lieutenant's Woman</b>, although Mr. Davies hardly needs Thomas Mann and John Fowles to prop him up." </p><p> Other reviewers praised the remarkable range of erudition he conveys in his works. Saints and card tricks, brandy and psychology, linguistics and bearded ladies are all objects of his insatiable curiosity. Davies is modest about the range of his learning, pointing out that some academics thought Shakespeare must have been a sailor because of the convincing seaman's slang in <b>The Tempest</b>: "It's all hooey. Shakespeare had a few telling details which he injected into his plays that made them seem realistic, and I have the same in my novels." A veteran once asked Davies where he had served in France during the Great War, for only a soldier could have captured the mud and panic of the trenches so vividly. Davies had to reply that he was in the cradle at the time. Similarly, his fictional prescription for bringing an ailing cello back to its true voice with a poultice of horse manure was pure fancy. Even the definition of "<b>Fifth Business</b>" that opens the book cited from a dull, untranslated account of Danish theater and first taken as yet another example of Davies's eccentric knowledge was revealed to be entirely fictional when the Norwegian edition of the book was published (although the notion it conveys of "<b>Fifth Business</b>" in the theater is quite accurate). </p><p> The key is to be convincing, true to the spirit rather than to mere facts. As Davies described the art of writing: </p><p> If you're a writer . . . you're a descendent of those medieval storytellers who used to go into the square of a town and spread a little mat on the ground and sit on it and beat on a bowl and say, 'If you give me a copper coin I will tell you a golden tale.' If the storyteller had what it took, he . . . told them a golden tale until it got to the most exciting point and then he passed the bowl again. </p><p> His storytelling prowess earned him frequent comparisons to Charles Dickens--a comparison of which he was not overly fond. The authors he admired included Victor Hugo, Honore de Balzac, Anthony Trollope, Evelyn Waugh, and Daniel Defoe, all very different writers, but all possessing what he called shamanstvo--the enchanter quality, from the word shaman. Like Dickens, Davies had a flair for the dramatic and could sketch a secondary character unforgettably in just a few lines (the portraits of Rev. Leadbeater, Orph Wettenhall, and Boy's stepdaughter Lorene in <b>Fifth Business</b>, for example). But he was more daring in his experiments with form than he is often given credit for, and his novelistic objectives are decidedly modern rather than Victorian. </p><p> As Michiko Kakutani wrote in the <b>New York Times</b>, Davies "has created a rich oeuvre of densely plotted, highly symbolic novels that not only function as superbly funny entertainments but also give the reader, in his character's words, a deeper kind of pleasure delight, awe, religious intimations, a fine sense of the past, and of the boundless depth and variety of life." </p><p> <b>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS</b><br><br> 1. When Percy Boyd Staunton denies his share of responsibility for the snowball that hit Mrs. Dempster and caused her premature labor, Dunstable Ramsay feels the full weight of guilt on his shoulders. Even years later, when he seeks out Mrs. Dempster again, he is highly sensitive to the magistrate's charge: <b>"Guilt . . . somebody bears it to this day!"</b> Why does he feel this guilt so keenly? To what extent is he responsible for Paul's fate? For Staunton's?<br><br> 2. Many of the characters in <b>Fifth Business</b> change their names. Dunstable Ramsay becomes Dunstan, Percy Boyd Staunton becomes Boy Staunton, Paul Dempster becomes Faustus Legrand and later Magnus Eisengrim. What happens when each of them is "born again"? Which aspects of their characters endure, and which are transformed? <br><br> 3. Young Dunstable's flight from his mother colors the rest of his life. When he contemplates his relationship with Diana, his first lover, he shuns the motherly quality of her affection: <b>"I had no intention of being anyone's dear laddie, ever again."</b> How and why do the other men in the novel (Boy Staunton, Paul Dempster) flee their mothers? What are they seeking in a woman? How are the ideal and the reality of motherhood and womanhood conveyed in Ramsay's reflections on the virgin Mary? <br><br> 4. "People marry most happily with their own kind," Davies once wrote. "The trouble lies in the fact that people usually marry at an age where they do not really know what their own kind is." What would have happened if Dunstan had married Leola? What kind of marriage would have better suited Boy?<br><br> </p><p>5. <b>"If you think her a saint, she is a saint to you,"</b> says Padre Blazon of Ramsay's fascination with Mary Dempster. What place does she come to occupy in his psychological landscape? Why is he so possessive of her, refusing to ask for Boy's assistance for her care? <br><br> 6. King Edward VIII of England was forced to abdicate in 1936 after less than a year in office because he wanted to marry Wallis Simpson, a twice-divorced American who was felt to be an unacceptable Queen. Why was this such a bitter blow to Boy? What did Edward represent to him? 7. If Ramsay is truly "<b>Fifth Business</b>," as Liesl describes, who are the hero and heroine, sorceress, and villain of the story?

He had three successive careers: as an actor with the Old Vic Company in England; as publisher of the Peterborough Examiner; and as university professor and first Master of Massey College at the University of Toronto, from which he retired in 1981 with the title of Master Emeritus. <br><br>&nbsp; <br><br>He was one of Canada&#x2019;s most distinguished men of letters, with several volumes of plays and collections of essays, speeches, and belles lettres to his credit. As a novelist, he gained worldwide fame for his three trilogies: The Salterton Trilogy, The Deptford Trilogy, and The Cornish Trilogy, and for later novels Murther &amp; Walking Spirits and The Cunning Man. <br><br>&nbsp; <br><br>His career was marked by many honours: He was the first Canadian to be made an Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, he was a Companion of the Order of Canada, and he received honorary degrees from twenty-six American, Canadian, and British universities.</p><h2>Mark Twain&#39;s Own Autobiography: The Chapters from the North American Review (Wisconsin Studies in Autobiography)</h2><p>&#x201c;I intend that this autobiography . . . shall be read and admired a good many centuries because of its form and method&#x2013;a form and method whereby the past and the present are constantly brought face to face, resulting in contrasts which newly fire up the interest all along, like contact of flint with steel.&#x201d;<br><br>Thus Mark Twain began the first of the twenty-five &#x201c;Chapters from My Autobiography&#x201d; published in the North American Review 1906&#x2013;1907. Those chapters contain a unified account of Twain's life recorded in his own unmistakable voice; in them we read his life's story as he intended it to be read and savored.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than just the story of a literary career, <i>Mark Twain&#x2019;s Own Autobiography</i> is securely anchored in the writer&#x2019;s relation to his family. His memories of his beloved wife Livy and daughter Susy&#x2013;what they meant to him as a husband, a father, and an artist&#x2013;constitute a poignant self-portrait. At the same time, this text draws on Twain&#x2019;s immense autobiographical writings for some of his best comic anecdotes, such as those that recall his rambunctious boyhood in Hannibal, his misadventures in the Nevada territory, and his notorious Whittier birthday speech.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Mark Twain&#x2019;s Own Autobiography</i> stands as the last of Twain&#x2019;s great yarns. Here he tells his story in his own way, freely expressing his joys and sorrows, his affections and hatreds, his rages and reverence&#x2013;ending, as always, tongue-in-cheek: &#x201c;Now, then, that is the tale.

Well, from 1950 until the late 1970s, a huge number of people begged to differ, as they devoured Immanuel Velikovsky&#x2019;s major best-seller, Worlds in Collision, insisting that perhaps this polymathic thinker held the key to a new science and a new history. Scientists, on the other hand, assaulted Velikovsky&#x2019;s book, his followers, and his press mercilessly from the get-go. In <i>The Pseudoscience Wars</i>, Michael D. Gordin resurrects the largely forgotten figure of Velikovsky and uses his strange career and surprisingly influential writings to explore the changing definitions of the line that separates legitimate scientific inquiry from what is deemed bunk, and to show how vital this question remains to us today. Drawing on a wealth of previously unpublished material from Velikovsky&#x2019;s personal archives, Gordin presents a behind-the-scenes history of the writer&#x2019;s career, from his initial burst of success through his growing influence on the counterculture, heated public battles with such luminaries as Carl Sagan, and eventual eclipse. Along the way, he offers fascinating glimpses into the histories and effects of other fringe doctrines, including creationism, Lysenkoism, parapsychology, and more&#x2014;all of which have surprising connections to Velikovsky&#x2019;s theories.&nbsp;Science today is hardly universally secure, and scientists seem themselves beset by critics, denialists, and those they label &#x201c;pseudoscientists&#x201d;&#x2014;as seen all too clearly in battles over evolution and climate change. <i>The Pseudoscience Wars </i>simultaneously reveals the surprising Cold War roots of our contemporary dilemma and points readers to a different approach to drawing the line between knowledge and nonsense.<br></p><p><p><b>Michael D.

As the publisher of <i>Skeptic</i> magazine and the 'Skeptic columnist for <i>Scientific American</i> I am frequently asked this question. Believe it or not, it'a a hard question to answer. Michael Gordin's <i>The Pseudoscience Wars</i> is the best single volume I have come across in my vast reading on the topic. He clearly and succinctly captures all sides on the debate, is rigorous in his research and fair to both believers and skeptics, and his narrative reconstruction of the Velikovsky affair makes for gripping reading. <i>The Pseudoscience Wars</i> is destined to become a classic in science literature."</p> (Michael Shermer, publisher of Skeptic magazine, monthly columnist for Scientific American , author of The Believing Brain)<br><br><p>&#x201c;Few issues loom more important today than the boundaries and authority of scientific expertise.

By delving deep into one of the earliest border skirmishes of the modern age&#x2014;the fascinating, beguiling case of Immanuel Velikovsky, his heterodox theories of human history and cosmic evolution, and the firestorm of protest they elicited from the scientific community&#x2014;Michael Gordin offers us a roadmap of the modern fringe.

This won't put an end to the debates that rage between legitimate scientific research and other fringe doctrines, but it does lay the Velikovsky affair to rest with fairness and clarity and will help to put into perspective many of the controversies swirling around today's scientific landscape.

Gordin's historical analysis of pseudoscience remains disturbingly relevant." (<i>Nature</i>)<br><br>"A slyly funny writer. . . . Make no mistake:&nbsp;Gordin's sympathies are not with the occult.&nbsp;His fascination with pseudoscience is more like a negative method: the experts define the boundaries of their domain by fending off the quacks.

Leading acupuncturists and researchers with international reputations share their expertise. They illustrate their descriptions with practical examples of what has worked and what has not. It outlines many of the key challenges in the field. These challenges relate to the nature of acupuncture and the gap between current research evidence and the actual experiences of acupuncturists in the field.

By incorporating a more sophisticated understanding of the field, this book details a range of strategies aiming to develop the evidence base with the utmost rigour.

From Biblical times&nbsp;to&nbsp;the present day, poetry has continuously drawn us to the natural world. In this thought-provoking book, John Felstiner explores the rich legacy of poems that take nature as their subject, and he demonstrates their force and beauty. In our own time of environmental crises, he contends, poetry has a unique capacity to restore our attention to our environment in its imperiled state. And, as we take heed, we may well become better stewards of the earth.</p><p>In forty brief and lucid chapters, Felstiner presents those voices that have most strongly spoken to and for the natural world. Poets&#x2014;from the Romantics through Whitman and Dickinson to Elizabeth Bishop and Gary Snyder&#x2014;have helped us envision such details as ocean winds eroding and rebuilding dunes in the same breath, wild deer freezing in our presence, and a person carving initials on a still-living stranded whale.</p><p>Sixty color and black-and-white images, many seen for the first time, bear out visually the environmental imagination this book discovers&#x2014;a poetic legacy more vital now than ever.</p></p><p><b>John Felstiner</b>, from Stanford University, wrote the prize-winning <i>Paul Celan: Poet, Survivor, Jew</i> and <i>Translating Neruda: The Way</i> <i>to Macchu Picchu.</i>&#34;&#39;Can Poetry Save the Earth? leads the reader through the landscapes of some wonderful poems... this book is manifestly a labour of love. Felstiner manages to be both ecstatic and admonitory, visionary and attentive to detail. His immense reading is like a forest through which he has lovingly carved out several inviting paths. That one is tempted to ponder alternative ways of organizing the book (poems about rivers, trees, meadows? poems about gardens, animals, the seasons?) is an acknowledgment of Felstiner&#39;s learned, enthusiastic and hopeful achievement.&#39; Times Literary Supplement &#39;a fine, clearly written and moving cry for an awareness of the depredations human kind are wreaking on the planet.&#39; Brimingham Post&#34;</p><h2>Essentials of Radiographic Physics and Imaging</h2><p>From basic physics principles to the actual process of producing diagnostic-quality x-rays, Essentials of Radiographic Physics and Imaging effectively guides you through the physics and imaging information you need to excel on your ARRT exam and as a professional radiographer.

Internationally famous Czech photographer Jan Saudek is no exception, and equally as uncompromising in pursuit of his own unique vision. For over four decades Saudek has created a parallel photographic universe, a two-dimensional home full of longing, peopled with the most extraordinary characters and colored by desire. The timeless strength of his hand-tinted photographs lies in their poetic compositions and their forceful?at times ribald?pictorial language, with its overtones of medieval genre pictures and Baroque mythology. Rejecting the traditional beauty in his famous nude photographs, Saudek shows the distinctively different: old women, fat women, children; real people in tableaux vivants that remind us of everything from surreal early movies to fin-de-siecle carnival nights. They exist outside time, a uniquely colored and almost mythical theater of dreams. Covering his debut in the 1950s through his lesser-known work to recent images, this dazzling collection offers us the true &#34;&#34;velvet revolution,&#34;&#34; fertile and unsettling images from the dreams we might still have.

His book is unique from other critiques on literary theory as he emphasizes the importance of the language spoken and not just language written. Frye writes in his first chapter, "Good writing must be based on good speech, it will never come alive it is based on reading alone."<p>"Frye divides language into a three-part model and walks the reader through each little nook-and-cranny of his idea. He divides language into the Poetic (rhythm caused by the beat of the words), Prose (rhythm caused by the sentence), and Associate (informal, everyday kind of talk.) Frye also divides the written language into his last chapter: Hieratic (High style) and Demiotic (low style).</p><p>"Frye's work is full of insight and intellectualism, and void of the intimidation factor which might be associated with a piece by Keats, Bloom, Eagleton, and other big name critics. Frye's diction is invitingly instructive, docilely dense, and meekly meticulous. His attention to detail and organization of thought work well to ensure the reader?s comprehension of Frye's obvious intellect."</p><p>&#x2014; <i> By D.A.

Over his lifetime Frye was awarded 30 honorary degrees world-wide, was a recipient of the Order of Canada, The Royal Society&#39;s Molson and Lorne Pierce Prizes, the Canada Council Medal, among others. His many publications include The Great Code,&#34;It is worth a hundred ordinary critical studies...&#34; - George P.

With balance and economy, he makes good use of relevant contemporary quotations and insight-laden discussions of personalitiesfamous, infamous, and little-knownin order to tell what happened and who did it. Coverage is also given to motivating ideologies and historical currents so that readers can understand why certain events took place. Marrin's chapter regarding the ``secret war'' of spies and codes should be of special interest to younger readers.

That night, across the Atlantic, Paul Revere mounted the fastest horse he could find and kicked it into a gallop.So began what have been called the "sister revolutions" of France and America. In a single, thrilling narrative, this book tells the story of those revolutions and shows just how deeply intertwined they actually were. Their leaders, George Washington and the Marquis de Lafayette, were often seen as father and son, but their relationship, while close, was every bit as complex as the long, fraught history of the French-American alliance. Vain, tough, ambitious, they strove to shape their characters and records into the form they wanted history to remember. James R. Gaines provides fascinating insights into these personal transformations and is equally brilliant at showing the extraordinary effect of the two "freedom fighters" on subsequent history. 8 pages of color and 8 pages of black-and-white illustrations; 2 maps</p><p>James R.

He lives with his family in Paris.The story told here is both sweeping and complex. James Gaines traces the intertwined histories of the American and French Revolutions by examining the lives and adventures of friends and colleagues George Washington and the Marquis de Lafayette. Each man offers a narrator multiple challenges: Washington kept to a carefully maintained public face. Lafayette moved between languages and continents. Once the narrative is well underway, Norman Dietz does a respectable job. He moves smoothly between languages and manages to evoke different voices, even those reading letters from third parties. At the beginning, however, Dietz's pace is so slow that it's distracting. It doesn't match the content of the history he's recounting and flattens its emotional impact. G.T.B. � AudioFile 2008, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>The Devil&#39;s Rope: A Cultural History of Barbed Wire</h2><p>Barbed wire cuts across more than just property, war and politics. This most vicious tool of control has played a critical role in the modern experience, be it territorial expansion or the settlement of local and international conflicts. However, it has other histories: those constructed through image and text in the arts, media and popular culture. These representations &#x2013; in painting, photography, poetry, personal memoirs, cartoons, novels, advertisements and film &#x2013; have never before been critically examined. In this book, Alan Krell investigates the place barbed wire holds in the social imagination.<br>Invented in France in 1860, barbed wire was developed independently in the USA, where it was used to control livestock on the Great Plains, both to "keep out" and "keep in". Promoted as the Ideal Fence, barbed wire&#x2019;s menacing qualities were soon made manifest. The epithet, "The Devil&#x2019;s Rope", anticipated its transformation into a tool of war in the late 19th and early 20th century. Henceforth, it would become synonymous with repression. Barbed wire&#x2019;s conflicting character makes it an appropriate symbol of modernity, and Krell shows how the use of this symbolism in contemporary art has given barbed wire meanings beyond the historical and political realms.</p><p>Alan Krell is Lecturer in Art History &amp; Theory at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia.This compact and dense volume's subtitle describes it accurately, warning the reader to expect less narrative or technological material than reflections on the meaning of barbed wire. The opening chapter does summarize the development of this instrument of war, which took the title nickname from the Plains Indians. Its beginnings were somewhat less violent: in a scramble for patents, three men who attended an 1873 DeKalb, Ill., county fair together separately invented barbed wire for cow control. A chapter on military uses of barbed wire focuses on the Holocaust and World War I before it (1,300 miles of wired-in trenches), but only tangentially mentions how the wire (in partnership with the machine gun) came to exert a four-year stranglehold on that war's Western Front. In "Making Familiar," the author devotes section to a cadre of barbed wire collectors. Similarly, chapters on the sexualization of barbed wire and its image in modern art explore many unconventional aspects of both sexuality (gay and straight) and protest art. The plentiful, high-quality graphic material, thorough annotation and occasionally opaque jargon are Reaktion trademarks, and regular readers of the British house will not be disappointed. Along the way, British art historian Krell (Manet and the Politics of Contemporary Life) does justice to the comic book renderings of barbed wire, as well as the movie Barb Wire, the Italian artist Toscani's Benetton advertisements and the Australian Jon Rose's surprisingly tuneful musical instruments made from strands of the wire.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>World on a String: A Musical Memoir</h2><p><b>Behind the scenes in the life of a musician&#x2014;an exuberant, entertaining memoir from jazz guitarist, singer, and raconteur John Pizzarelli</b><p>John Pizzarelli, the son of jazz guitar legend Bucky Pizzarelli, is a connoisseur of American song who grew up among the legends of jazz.

A connoisseur of the American songbook and the rich history of jazz, John received his first banjo and guitar lessons from two uncles, professional musicians who had taught his father to play, and he grew up surrounded by talented musicians who knew how to spin a yarn.

From the point of view of a modern reader, brought up to regard the wresting of Magna Carta from King John as the most important event in his reign, Shakespeare&#39;s complete omission of any mention of this aspect of King John&#39;s struggle with the barons will also seem odd.</p><h2>Complete Gde to Native Orchids of Australia</h2><p>In this spectacular and comprehensive book, orchid expert David Jones describes more than 1300 species and subspecies of Australian native orchids.

Their affair does not last long, however, once the enraged Schomberg sends agents of revenge to invade Heyst&#x2019;s island retreat. Out of the maelstrom of violence and tragedy that ensues, Conrad produces a profound, unflinching meditation on human connection and redemption.</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.In Victory (1915) Conrad returns to the Malay Archipelago, to the setting of his first mature novel, Lord Jim, and in Axel Heyst he creates a hero who is in many ways similar to Jim, a noble altruist destroyed by his ideals. Heyst is emotionally crippled by the influence of his dead father, a sceptical philosopher who has bequeathed to Heyst an attitude to life summed up in the father&#39;s dying words: &#39;Look on - make no sound.&#39; Despite this injunction Heyst allows himself to become inextricably involved with an English Cockney girl whom he rescues from Giancomo&#39;s Travelling Ladies&#39; Orchestra and carries off to his isolated retreat on the island of Samburan. His action incurs the fatal wrath of Schomberg, the island&#39;s innkeeper, who sends in pursuit of Heyst three demonic strangers whose invasion of his island paradise leads rapidly to the novel&#39;s violent and tragic close. Victory was the first of Conrad&#39;s novels to be completed after the commercial success of Chance (1914) had transformed Conrad&#39;s fortunes and made him internationally famous. It is a more complex example of the literary form which Conrad evolved for Lord Jim: a story of action and high adventure coexisting with an exhaustive study of the psychology of the central character.</p><h2>Goodman and Gilman&#39;s Manual of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</h2><p><p><b>Put the authority of Goodman &amp; Gilman's in the palm of your hand!</b></p> <p><b>5 STAR DOODY'S REVIEW!</b><br> "...the most authoritative and trusted source of pharmacological information, has now spawned a portable pocket drug guide....This manual extracts the essential core drug information from the eleventh edition of the parent book, referring the reader to the online version of the parent book for historical aspects, many chemical and clinical details, and additional figures and references.

No matter how much danger he faced, we always knew Chris would come out alive with an awesome story filled with close calls. To say I lost a friend this year does not say enough. I lost someone I looked up to as a frogman and Texan brother. He exemplified each word of the SEAL Creed, and he deserves the highest honor and respect for what he put on the line to keep his brothers safe from the enemy. I know there are mothers and fathers out there right now who are grateful their son or daughter returned home from war thanks to Chris Kyle. He saved countless lives. Whether he sat high on a rooftop taking out the enemy threatening his teammates, or if he was fighting side-by-side with a Marine platoon, his mission was always clear: &#x201c;draw on every remaining ounce of strength to protect his brothers.&#x201d;</p> <p>Chris gave a piece of his life to the SEAL teams, but there came a time when he needed to refocus on his family. No matter how difficult his decision to leave the military, he knew he was doing was right thing for his wife and two children. He became well known after the much-deserved success of his first book, <i>American Sniper</i>. The way he handled himself under the spotlight and shared his passions are a testament to the man he was. Chris gave away the proceeds of his book to veterans and families of fallen teammates. He was the founder of a security company that was dedicated to teaching fine skills to law enforcement and other security details. He was committed to his family, he was committed to helping veterans, he was committed to several charities, he was committed to serving others. That was Chris. He lived by his own rules, and I couldn&#x2019;t respect him more.</p> <p>I am so glad to see this important book, <i>American Gun: A History of the U.S. in Ten Firearms</i>, come to life, because it meant so much to Chris to get it completed. It&#x2019;s a testament to his service, and it proves that he wasn&#x2019;t a guy who just wanted to be known for his kill count. He had an incredible respect for his country, our history, and preserving the second amendment&#x2014;he also had an almost unmatched knowledge of firearms. This book is filled with his passion for a fine gun, shows clearly how our national relationship with firearms got to where it is today, and reveals the many fascinating ways guns have shaped American history. It&#x2019;s also a hell of a good read--full of amazing stories of American soldiers, cowboys, and heroes, from the Revolution, Civil War, Wild West, world wars, Iraq, and beyond. </p> <p>I have to pay tribute to Chris&#x2019;s wife Taya, who wrote the foreword and afterword in <i>American Gun</i>. Taya is carrying the torch for Chris, their kids, and for those who he fought to defend. She has promised to see through all of the projects Chris left behind, as well as ensure Chris's memory is honored as it should be. I think Chris married a person who may be stronger than even he was&#x2014;that&#x2019;s saying something. With Chris&#x2019;s spirit beside her, she is never out of the fight. Lastly, y&#x2019;all should know Taya and their kids receive the author proceeds of <i>American Gun</i>, so buy this awesome book in bulk and share with friends.</p><p>Drawing on his legendary firearms knowledge and combat&nbsp;experience, U.S. Navy SEAL and #1 bestselling author of American Sniper Chris Kyle dramatically chronicles the story of&nbsp;America&#x2014;from the Revolution to the present&#x2014;through the lens of ten iconic guns&nbsp;and the remarkable heroes who used them to shape history: the American long&nbsp;rifle, Spencer repeater, Colt .45 revolver, Winchester 1873 rifle, Springfield&nbsp;M1903 rifle, M1911 pistol, Thompson submachine gun, M1 Garand, .38 Special&nbsp;police revolver, and the M16 rifle platform Kyle himself used.

Young Harriett Frean is taught that "behaving beautifully" is paramount, and she becomes a self-sacrificing woman whose choices prove devastating to herself and to those who love her most. An early pioneer of<br>stream-of-consciousness writing, Sinclair employs the technique brilliantly in this finely crafted psychological novel. Evoking the style and depth of her contemporaries Virginia Woolf and D. H. Lawrence, Sinclair's haunting narrative also reflects her keen interest in the theories of Jung and Freud.

Kameenui is associate professor and associate dean in the College of Education for the Division of Learning and Instructional Leadership at the University of Oregon.<p> The second edition of <i>Instructional Classroom Management: A Proactive Approach to Behavior Management</i> continues to be about managing behavior from an instructional point of view. We are convinced more than ever that effective management strategies for all ages and ability levels must begin with an educational analysis of the problem, followed by a solution grounded in instructional principles. We discuss that students can best be taught academic, behavioral, and social skills through the use of research-based instructional procedures and intervention strategies. The design and philosophy of our approach helps teachers proactively manage their school and instructional environments. </p> <p> The second edition was developed for classroom teachers, school administrators, school counselors and psychologists, and professionals charged with the responsibility of guiding educational programs for students. It is comprehensive in scope, presenting a proactive management system designed to decrease student behavior problems in schools. In addition, we provide a full range of strategies for teaching and correcting disruptive behavior once it occurs. The conceptual framework of the text and the intervention strategies presented are based on current research in the field. This edition integrates current research into a management plan that is effective for an entire school year. This plan includes assessment and instruction that allow the teacher to develop teaching plans to proactively reduce the occurrence of disruptive behavior in the classroom and the school. In addition, we have developed a more comprehensive list of reinforcement strategies to use with students of all ages and ability levels. </p> <p> Dr. George Sugai of the University of Oregon and his colleagues have contributed two chapters to our text. First, Chapter 7 is about teaching students social skills. Sugai and his colleagues present a plan for teachers to both assess students' social skills and teach critical social skills. The techniques discussed in this chapter are research-based and organized so that teachers can effectively implement them with students in need of social skills instruction. In addition, Sugai and his colleagues have contributed Chapter 10 on school-wide discipline and instructional classroom management. This research-based school-wide discipline system is a proactive instructional approach organized around a 180-day plan that can be effectively implemented at the classroom and school level. </p> <p><b>A NOTE TO THE READER AND INSTRUCTOR</b></p> <p> In this edition, we have upgraded and expanded the pedagogical features to aid instruction and learning. </p> <ul> <li>We have increased the number of instructional examples in the text to provide the reader with a range of examples of teachers managing classroom behavior.

This dramatic transformation has been understood in two very different ways--as a series of consensual transactions, but also as a process of violent conquest. Both views cannot be correct. How did Indians actually lose their land?<br></p><p><br></p><p><br><br>Stuart Banner provides the first comprehensive answer. He argues that neither simple coercion nor simple consent reflects the complicated legal history of land transfers. Instead, time, place, and the balance of power between Indians and settlers decided the outcome of land struggles. As whites' power grew, they were able to establish the legal institutions and the rules by which land transactions would be made and enforced.<br></p><p><br></p><p><br><br>This story of America's colonization remains a story of power, but a more complex kind of power than historians have acknowledged. It is a story in which military force was less important than the power to shape the legal framework within which land would be owned. As a result, white Americans--from eastern cities to the western frontiers--could believe they were buying land from the Indians the same way they bought land from one another. <i>How the Indians Lost Their Land</i> dramatically reveals how subtle changes in the law can determine the fate of a nation, and our understanding of the past.<br></p></p><p>Stuart Banner is Norman Abrams Professor of Law at the University of California, Los Angeles.In deceptively simple prose, Stuart Banner lays out the complexities and contradictions of the long history of how Anglo-Americans justified the dispossession of Native Americans. His even-handed exploration of the moral gymnastics necessary for lawyers, politicians, and writers to make expropriation seem logical and Native participation voluntary breathes new life into the old saying about the pen proving mightier than the sword. (Daniel K. Richter, author of <i>Facing East from Indian Country: A Native History of Early America</i>)<br><br>In a subtle and sometimes startling reinterpretation of 18th and 19th century North American land transfers, Stuart Banner shows how relentlessly expansionary colonial powers met active and savvy Indians who worked to protect their interests as best they could. In the end, it was the English and American power to declare what was lawful that transformed power into right and facilitated increasingly involuntary land transfers at extraordinarily low prices, leaving the Indians worse off than before and bereft of a continent. (Joseph William Singer, Professor of Law, Harvard Law School)<br><br>Banner's well-documented history addresses the question of how repeated land sales drove Indians west, with a careful detailing of transactions from the 1600s to the 1900s. Did the Indians think they were agreeing only to 'share resources,' and were the English aware of the Indians' increasing poverty as a result of these one-sided transactions? The author describes how land sales changed from contracts between private parties to treaties between sovereign nations after the end of the French and Indian War in 1763, followed by the convenient perception of Native Americans not as owners of their land but merely<br>as occupants. (Deborah Donovan <i>Booklist</i> 2005-10-01)<br><br>[An] important new study...Despite the common belief that colonists simply took what they wanted by right of conquest, Banner shows that English colonial policy recognized Indians as legitimate owners of the land. That policy was continued by the American nation-state. If the colonies--or, later, the US federal government--wanted Indian land, it had to be purchased or otherwise obtained by cession through legitimate treaty. This policy, Banner argues, developed not out of respect for Indians but out of concern for settlers. After all, it was far less expensive to purchase land than to expend the blood and treasure required to seize it. And deeds of sale or treaties of cession provided a much firmer legal foundation for a property system than did wars of conquest. Banner acknowledges that raw power was important. As settlers grew stronger in relation to Indians, he argues, fraud and violence became more widespread. Yet the legal formalities were preserved. (John Mack Faragher <i>Bookforum</i> 2006-02-01)<br><br>Stuart Banner has written an intriguing account examining the dynamic and convoluted territorial, legal, political, and economic relationships among indigenous nations and colonial nations, particularly Great Britain, and its principal successor, the United States...Banner provides, especially in the first two-thirds of the book, a fresh perspective--utilizing a variety of high quality original and secondary materials--on one of the most crucial questions that has animated indigenous/nonindigenous relations since the arrival of Europeans: how and why did Native peoples lose ownership of ninety-eight percent of their lands to non-Natives? This powerful question has generally occupied the attention of many people inside and outside the academy, but very few have explored it to the depth that Banner has...This is a text that is quite striking, informative, and one that will be useful to a variety of audiences: historians, legal scholars, political scientists, and sociologists, among others...I hope it enjoys a wide readership as it deftly addresses important questions regarding land and sovereignty that continue to have great legal, property, and moral potency today. (David E. Wilkins <i>American Historical Review</i>)<br><br>Banner's book, which is well suited for undergraduate use, is a wonderful introduction to a surprisingly complex subject.

He discusses the land policies pursued by the English and American governments as well as the intellectual and legal justifications for those policies...Banner skillfully avoids casting this tale as a simple morality play.

(F. Todd Smith <i>Historian</i>)<br><br>Banner contributes a major new conceptualization and many fresh insights into how the Indians lost their land...[the] studies compel readers to reconsider many aspects of Indian history, identity, and issues related to removal, migration, and life on reservations...Both specialists and nonspecialists will find these studies interesting and beneficial...they raise important questions and answer them in detail with new discoveries and insights.

The title story returns to Nottinghamshire countryside and tells of the mutual jealousy of the two brothers, both fiercely shy of women, and their initiation one summer&#39;s night after the harvesting.</p><p>Love Among the Haystacks and Other Stories gathers together all of Lawrence&#39;s short stories not collected in the Prussian Officer volume. Each story in this edition appears in a new, authoritative text based on the manuscripts, typescripts, corrected proofs and early printings.The son of a miner, the prolific novelist, poet, and travel writer David Herbert Lawrence was born in Eastwood, Nottinghamshire, in 1885. He attended Nottingham University and found employment as a schoolteacher. His first novel, <i>The White Peacock</i>, was published in 1911, the same year his beloved mother died and he quit teaching after contracting pneumonia. The next year Lawrence published <i>Sons and Lovers</i> and ran off to Germany with Frieda Weekley, his former tutor&#x2019;s wife. His masterpieces <i>The Rainbow</i> and <i>Women in Love</i> were completed in quick succession, but the first was suppressed as indecent and the second was not published until 1920. Lawrence&#x2019;s lyrical writings challenged convention, promoting a return to an ideal of nature where sex is seen as a sacrament. In 1928 Lawrence&#x2019;s final novel, <i>Lady Chatterley&#x2019;s Lover</i>, was banned in England and the United States for indecency. He died of tuberculosis in 1930 in Venice.</p><h2>Explorations: La litterature du monde fran�ais (with Syst�me-D 3.0 CD-ROM: Writing Assistant for French)</h2><p>Explorations combines engaging literary readings at the intermediate level with a step-by step approach to reading development.

Why improve on what&#x2019;s already outstanding? Because now it can be made even better. In the years since the 1985 publication of the first Zondervan NIV Study Bible edition, ongoing discoveries in archaeology, linguistics, biblical history, and other disciplines have suggested the need to revise the notes. Drawing on the most current scholarship, the world-class team who first created the study notes now present comprehensive revisions and additions that bring the notes thoroughly up to date.

If you found the original notes indispensable in clarifying obscure Bible passages and shedding light on the meaning and significance of Scripture, you&#x2019;ll love how these revised and expanded notes add even greater depth to your study of God&#x2019;s Word. The New International Version (NIV) is today&#x2019;s most read and most trusted English Bible translation. The goal of the NIV translation team was to produce an accurate translation and one that would have clarity and literary quality and so prove suitable for public and private reading, teaching, preaching, memorizing, and liturgical use. Today the NIV is accepted by more denominations than any other translation and is supported by a library of reference resources that is unmatched by any other translation. Over the last five years, the editors of the NIV study Bible have painstakingly reviewed, revised, and rewritten the notes of the classic, best-selling NIV Study Bible. Over 80 percent of the notes have been revised and adapted in some way from the 1996 update, and some 30% of the notes in the text have been added, completely rewritten, replaced, or deleted. Over 800 of the more than 20,000 notes in this edition are completely new. This update reflects the most recent scholarship from a conservative academic perspective, and reflects changes to the text suggested and requested over the last 15 years by students and academics who have studied, used, and loved the NIV Study Bible.</p>The New International Version is the world&#39;s most popular modern English Bible translation. Developed by Biblica, formerly the International Bible Society, the New International Version is the result of years of work by the Committee on Bible Translation, overseeing the efforts of many contributing scholars.

This historical anthology is unique in its presentation of cross cultural writings--especially from Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Cuban writers and political documents--that shape the ideology and experience of U.S. Latinos. Students can read, first hand, the works or authors who most shaped their cultural heritage. They are guided by vivid introductions that set each article or document in its historical context and describe its relevance today. The writings touch on many themes, but are guided by this book&#39;s concern for a quest for public citizenship among all Latino populations and a better understanding of racialized populations in the U.S. today.</p><p>Francisco H. V�zquez is professor of history and philosophy and director of the Hutchins Institute for Public Policy Studies and Community Action at Sonoma State University, California. Among his publications are: &#39;Philosophy in Mexico: The Opium of the Intellectuals or a Prophetic Insight,&#39; (Canadian Journal of Political and Social Theory, Vol. 4, No. 3 , 1980) and &#39;Chicanology: A Postmodern Analysis of Meshicano Discourse,&#39; (Perspectives in Mexican Amercian Studies, Volume 3, 1992).With the publication of this new edition of <i>Latino/a Thought</i>, Vazquez has done a great service to scholars, the Latino community, and the general public. Framed within the global and transnational context and the history of Latino struggles for social justice and political empowerment, this is simply the best, most comprehensive, collection of essays available on the Latinos/as in the United States. Readers will find here a wide range of documents and analyses of critical historical, socioeconomic, political, and cultural concern. It is an ideal primer for the classroom or simply for all those seeking a well-rounded overview of the historical and contemporary Latino/a reality. (William I.

This book presents the central ideas of modern numerical analysis in a vivid and straightforward fashion with a minimum of fuss and formality. Stewart designed this volume while teaching an upper-division course in introductory numerical analysis. To clarify what he was teaching, he wrote down each lecture immediately after it was given. The result reflects the wit, insight, and verbal craftmanship which are hallmarks of the author. Simple examples are used to introduce each topic, then the author quickly moves on to the discussion of important methods and techniques. With its rich mixture of graphs and code segments, the book provides insights and advice that help the reader avoid the many pitfalls in numerical computation that can easily trap an unwary beginner.</p><p>This book presents the central ideas of modern numerical analysis in a vivid and straightforward fashion with a minimum of fuss and formality. Stewart designed this volume while teaching an upper-division course in introductory numerical analysis.</p><h2>The Oxford History of Western Art</h2><p><em>The Oxford History of Western Art</em> is an innovative and challenging reappraisal of how the history of art can be presented and understood. Through a carefully devised modular structure, readers are given insights not only into how and why works of art were created, but also how works in different media relate to each other across time. Here--uniquely--is not the simple, linear "story" of art, but a rich series of stories, told from varying viewpoints.<br> Carefully selected groupings of pictures give readers a sense of the visual "texture" of the various periods and episodes covered. The 167 illustration groups, supported by explanatory text and picture captions, create a sequence of "visual tours"--not merely a procession of individually "great" works viewed in isolation, but juxtapositions of significant images that powerfully convey a sense of the visual environments in which works of art need to be viewed in order to be understood and appreciated. The aim throughout is to make the shape and nature of these visual presentations a stimulating and rewarding experience, allowing readers to become active participants in the process of interpretation and synthesis.<br> Another key feature of the narrative is the re-definition of traditional period boundaries. Rather than relying on conventional labels such as Medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque, the book establishes five major phases of significant historical change that unlock longer and more meaningful continuities. This new framework shows how the major religious and secular functions of art have been forged, sustained, transformed, revived, and revolutionized over the ages; how the institutions of Church and State have consistently aspired to make art in their own image; and how the rise of art history itself has come to provide the dominant conceptual framework within which artists create, patrons patronize, collectors collect, galleries exhibit, dealers deal, and art historians write.<br> Though the coverage of topics focuses on European notions of art and their transplantation and transformation in North America, space is also given to cross-fertilizations with other traditions---including the art of Latin America, the Soviet Union, India, Africa (and Afro-Caribbean), Australia, and Canada.<br> Written by a team of 50 specialist authors working under the direction of renowned art historian Martin Kemp, <em>The Oxford History of Western Art</em> is a vibrant, vigorous, and revolutionary account of Western art serving both as an inspirational introduction for the general reader and an authoritative source of reference and guidance for students.</p><p><br><strong>Martin Kemp</strong>, British Academy Wolfson Professor (1993-8) and Professor of the History of Art, University of Oxford, is one of the UK's most distinguished art historians. His many publications include <em>Leonardo da Vinci: Artist, Scientist, Inventor; The Science of Art</em>; and <em>Behind the Picture: Art and</em> <em>Evidence in the Italian Renaissance.</em> He lives in the U.K.<br>The dogmatic overviews of art that are the traditional texts for students in college-level survey classes and the occasional museum-goer are overthrown by this refreshing and accessible survey. Instead of foregone conclusions, renowned art historian Kemp and his 50 contributors (representing a diversity of backgrounds and specialties) offer an elasticized look at art and an understanding that poses as many questions as it answers. Instead of taking a purely visual approach (i.e., organized by style and medium along a linear chronology), Kemp focuses on social, religious and political history, occasionally showing art in situ and juxtaposing photos by subject matter, but without ignoring standard art historical pedagogy. The first section, for example, focuses on the classical art of ancient Greece and Rome, but includes a subsection on "Ancient Paradigms from Augustus to Mussolini." The final section, "Modernism and After," extends the book's western reach to include the art of the Soviet Union, Latin America and India, and discusses the roles of art museums and galleries and the evolving discipline of art history. "Ultimately, there is no reason to look at art," Kemp writes in the epilogue, "but many of us cannot stop doing it, and it clearly meets fundamental human needs visually, intellectually, and psychologically. This book is designed to assist in meeting those needs." And so it does.

Nuttall discusses English eighteenth-century and French neo-classical conceptions of realism, and considers<i> Julius Caesar</i>, <i>Coriolanus</i>, <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>, <i>Othello</i>, and both parts of <i>King Henry IV</i> as a prolonged feat of mimesis, with particular emphasis on Shakespeare&#x2019;s perception of society and culture as subject to historical change. Shakespeare is chosen as the great example of realism because he addresses not only the stable characteristics but also the flux of things, and he is thus seen as a perceiver of that flux and not a mere specimen. An acknowledged classic of literary studies, <i>A New Mimesis </i>is reissued here with a new preface by the author.</p><p><b>A. D. Nuttall</b> is professor of English at Oxford University and the author of numerous books, including <i>Shakespeare the Thinker</i>, published by Yale University Press<i>,</i> <i>A Common Sky: Philosophy and the Literary Imagination</i>, and <i>Why Does Tragedy Give Pleasure?</i>"Nuttall's most important book on Shakespeare seems as fresh and challenging as ever."&#x2015;Graham Bradshaw, author of <i>Shakespeare's Scepticism</i> (Graham Bradshaw)</p><h2>Solomonic Judgements: Studies in the Limitation of Rationality</h2><p>This volume of essays is very much a sequel to the two earlier collections by Jon Elster, Ulysses and the Sirens and Sour Grapes. His topic is rationality--its scope, its limitations, and its failures. Elster considers rational responses to the insufficiency of reason itself and to the &#34;indeterminacies&#34; in deploying rational choice theory, and discusses the irrationality of not seeing when, where, and what these are. A key essay that gives the collection its title examines disputes in cases of child custody that are paradigmatically indeterminate. Leaving aside cases where one parent is patently unfit and assuming that protracted dispute is against the immediate interests of the child, Elster argues that three options present themselves: a strong presumption in favor of the mother, a strong presumption in favor of the primary caretaker, and tossing a coin. Though the first two options may be preferable in the short term, Elster argues that there is a case for randomization in the long term.</p><p>The topic is rationality--its scope, limitations and failures--in this consideration of rational responses to instances where reason alone is insufficient, as in disputes over child custody.</p><h2>AIDS: Cultural Analysis / Cultural Activism (October Books)</h2><p><p>The literature on AIDS has attempted to teach us the "facts" about this new disease or to provide a narrative account of scientific discovery and developing public health policy. But AIDS has precipitated a crisis that is not primarily medical, or even social and political; AIDS has precipitated a crisis of signification the "meaning" of AIDS is hotly contested in all of the discourses that conceptualize it and seek to respond to it <i>.

She reported the encounter to Joyce, who subsequently sought out Gilbert. Their meeting began a literary collaboration and friendship that lasted until Joyce&#39;s death in 1941. This journal is a chronicle of that remarkable and productive friendship. Stuart Gilbert records many amusing anecdotes and provocative opinions regarding Joyce&#39;s social life, his relationship with his wife, Nora, and his compositional techniques for Finnegans Wake. Also included in the book are some of Joyce&#39;s previously unpublished letters to Gilbert (also reproduced in photographs), numerous unpublished photographs, and a typically dyspeptic 1941 essay on Joyce, Paul L�on, and Herbert Gorman by Gilbert. The volume is fully annotated and contains an introduction by noted Joyce scholar Thomas F. Staley. These materials from the Stuart Gilbert Archive of the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin offer new perspectives on literary Paris of the 1920s and 1930s. They will be important for everyone interested in the modernist period.</p><p>Thomas F. Staley is the director of the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center, where Randolph Lewis is a research associate."This is a slim book, very easy to read, with copious notes, a brief and informative introduction, and some interesting photographs. Gilbert's distinctive perspective will be of interest to those concerned with the ongoing relativisation of the Joycean biography and to anyone who enjoys a sweet slice of literary gossip, motivated, in this case, by a rather classical form of jealousy."

Over the next eighty days, immediately upon waking, he wrote down his dreams, following the instructions in <i>An Experiment with Time</i> by British philosopher John Dunne. The purpose was to test the theory that time may go in reverse, so that a later event may generate an earlier dream. The result&#x2015;published here for the first time&#x2015;is a fascinating diary in which Nabokov recorded sixty-four dreams (and subsequent daytime episodes) on 118 index cards, providing a rare glimpse of the artist at his most private. <i>Insomniac Dreams</i> presents the text of Nabokov's dream experiment, illustrated with a selection of his original index cards, and provides rich annotations and analysis that put them in the context of his life and writings.</p></p><p><p>"Who needs fantasy fiction when you can plunge through the trapdoor in Nabokov's pillow into his lucid dreamworlds, with Gennady Barabtarlo as sage companion and guide?"<b>--Brian Boyd, author of <i>Vladimir Nabokov: The Russian Years</i> and <i>Vladimir Nabokov: The American Years</i></b></p><p>"Nabokov's amazing records of his dreams are priceless, and their publication will create a much-deserved critical buzz. They show Nabokov at his most vulnerable, raw, and genuine, giving us rare glimpses into his past, his feelings about his parents, his relationship with his wife and son, and his anxieties and hopes. This is a very important book."<b>--Galya Diment, University of Washington</b></p><p>"Nabokov's notes about his dream experiment offer a private, unguarded view into his inner life during the rich autumn of his genius. By revealing a new facet of Nabokov's fascination with the nature of time and the otherworld, they show his remarkable openness to radical ways of thinking.

Reprint.</p><p>Wolfgang Puck's first book, written before he became wildly famous as the owner-chef of Spago and Chinois, offers more than 160 complex, innovative recipes that employ elements both familiar and surprising. <i>Modern French Cooking for the American Kitchen</i> focuses on the basics of French cooking rather than the self-consciously avant-garde fusion food that Puck helped to pioneer. But, as Wolfgang himself says, he is "never intimidated by tradition" and the recipes in this book are hardly ordinary. Dishes such as Zucchini Flowers Filled with Shrimp Mousse, fresh and nontraditional from conception, set the tone. Bold flavors are the rule here; even simple-sounding recipes prove to be rich and intricate. Lobster with Herbs, for example, is served with both a tomato-basil b�arnaise and a beurre blanc with <i>herbes de Provence</i>. Illustrated with clear and helpful drawings and succinctly laid out, intimidating gems such as a Sweetbread Torte (baked in puff pastry with ham, black olives, cream, and port) seem almost straightforward. Throughout the book, Puck interjects vignettes from his childhood, musings on different ingredients, and his opinions on the philosophy of cooking. His enthusiasm is infectious; before you know it, your copy will be dog-eared and slathered in butter. <i>-- David Kalil</i>Wolfganf Puck, the celebrated chef-owner of Spago, is at the vanguard of American cuisine.

Anne Elliot is persuaded by her friends and family to reject a marriage proposal from Captain Wentworth because he lacks in fortune and rank. More than seven years later, when he returns home from the Navy, Anne realises she still has strong feelings for him, but Wentworth only appears to have eyes for a friend of Anne&#39;s. Moving, tender, but intrinsically &#39;Austen&#39; in style, with it&#39;s satirical portrayal of the vanity of society in eighteenth-century England, Persuasion celebrates enduring love and hope.</p><p>Anne Elliot, heroine of Austen&#39;s last novel, did something we can all relate to: Long ago, she let the love of her life get away. In this case, she had allowed herself to be persuaded by a trusted family friend that the young man she loved wasn&#39;t an adequate match, social stationwise, and that Anne could do better. The novel opens some seven years after Anne sent her beau packing, and she&#39;s still alone. But then the guy she never stopped loving comes back from the sea. As always, Austen&#39;s storytelling is so confident, you can&#39;t help but allow yourself to be taken on the enjoyable journey.This book is in Electronic Paperback Format.

Using a step-by-step approach, it explains everything needed to understand PSpice and apply it in a creative way to the analysis of electric and electronic circuits and devices. The focus is on the development of models (e.g., for such devices as the bipolar junction transistor, the field-effect transistor, and the operational amplifier) to help readers develop their own models for other devices, especially those where linear approximations are all that is needed. <b> </b> Thirteen chapters cover most of the topics that are included in dc and ac circuit analysis, semiconductor devices and circuits, operational amplifiers, two-port networks, and filters; four chapters are then devoted to the same topics using the tools available in Schematics or Capture. <b> </b> For anyone who wants to learn more about computer aids to circuit analysis. </p></p><p>Preface <p> Methods of circuit analysis vary widely, depending on the complexity of the problem. Whereas some circuits require nothing more complicated than the writing of a single equation for their solution, others require that several equations be solved simultaneously. When the response of a circuit is to be performed over a wide range of frequencies, the work is often both tedious and time consuming. Various tools ranging from trig tables and slide rules to calculators and computers have been used by those eager to ease the burden of lengthy computations. </p><p> In many cases the problem to be solved requires that the student have an understanding of which basic laws and principles are involved in the solution. In some cases, if the topology of a network is known, along with complete descriptions of the elements that are connected among the various nodes, computer programs can be used to perform the analyses. </p><p> Such programs have been under development for several decades. If you have access to a computer language such as BASIC, Pascal, or FORTRAN, you can devise your own programs to readily solve certain types of problems. More powerful programs, capable of solving many types of electrical networks under a variety of conditions, require years to develop and update. What Is SPICE? </p><p> Such a program is SPICE, which stands for Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis. The version of SPICE used in this book is PSpice, a commercial product developed by the MicroSim Corporation. In 1998, the company merged with OrCAD, producing release 9 of the software. The evaluation version of the program, which is packaged with this text, is sufficient to perform all the exercises and simulations in this book. </p><p> The evaluation version is fully functioning, but it has file size limitations. A more specific description of the software contents can be found in the README file on the accompanying CD-ROM. </p><p> The SPICE program is both powerful and flexible. At the same time, it can be intimidating and bewildering to the beginner, who might well ask, How do I use this mighty tool in the most elementary way? </p><p> Although it might appear foolish to use a powerful hammer to drive a tack, if novices can solve problems with SPICE for which they already know the answers, they will gain confidence to move ahead. Thus, this text begins with do circuit analysis, proceeds with ac circuit analysis, then goes into the various topics involving semiconductors. </p><p> PSpice is widely used in industry for the main purpose of allowing the designer to investigate the behavior of a circuit without having to actually breadboard the circuit in the laboratory. This allows for a considerable savings in materials and labor. If the design needs to be modified or tweaked, changes can easily be submitted to the computer for another look at the results. The designer is familiar with the components that will eventually be used in the actual circuit. He or she understands their electrical properties and behavior. How large numbers of these components will interact, however, is sometimes difficult to predict. This is where the computer program takes over, going through the tedious solutions much more quickly and with far less chance for mistakes than the human approach. </p><p> Should every electrical student, practitioner, and designer learn SPICE and use it? I believe the answer is an unqualified yes. It has become a standard in both the academic and professional worlds. Your education will not be complete without an exposure to this valuable tool. </p><p> Will SPICE teach you what you need to know to perform both circuit analysis and design? I believe the answer is an unqualified no. A study of the basic laws that govern circuit behavior is just as important today as it ever was. SPICE and other computer aids of the same nature will merely free you of the drudgery of lengthy and repetitive computations. You will surely gain some additional knowledge in the process, which you might otherwise overlook. You will also enjoy using Probe, a feature of PSpice that allows you to plot circuit response involving functions of frequency and time, among other things. </p><p> The motivation for this book comes from a desire to present a simple, easy-to-follow guide to PSpice to students who want to learn more about computer aids to circuit analysis. The material is presented in such a way that anyone who is studying or has studied the various electrical topics will be able immediately to put PSpice to practical use. </p><p> An important feature of the book is the development of models for such devices as the bipolar junction transistor (BJT), the field-effect transistor (FET), and the operational amplifier (op amp). The models need be no more complicated than necessary for the problem at hand. For example, if you are interested in bias voltages and currents for the BJT, there is no need for a model of the transistor that takes ac quantities into account. It is hoped that the readers will be able to develop their own models for other devices, especially those where linear approximations are all that is needed. </p><p> When reading this book, be aware that you will learn much more by going through each example on the computer. It is important that you produce the required input (circuit) files, submit them to the PSpice program, then look at the output files and/or Probe to see the results. Only by actual experience with the computer will you begin to appreciate the power at your disposal and the satisfaction that comes from seeing the solutions appear on your monitor and printer. Schematics and Capture CIS </p><p> The product that allows the circuit designer to place the various components of a circuit on an electronic drawing board prior to carrying out the analysis of a circuit in PSpice is called Schematics. MicroSim supported Schematics until the merger with OrCAD. Then, OrCAD's Capture CIS superseded Schematics. The two programs bear little resemblance. Therefore, if you have learned to use Schematics, you have much to learn before even attempting to simulate circuits in Capture. This further supports the author's decision to introduce SPICE in the form in which it historically developed. </p><p> You begin with a hand-drawn sketch of an electrical or electronic circuit in which nodes are labeled, usually in numerical sequence. The ground point is the zero node, and you must label all other nodes. Then you identify the elements of the circuit one by one on a single line of a file that is called a circuit (or input) file. Such files always have the extension cir. When the entire circuit has been characterized, the analysis (or simulation) takes place. The results will tell you a great deal (sometime more, sometimes less) about the behavior of the circuit under a variety of conditions. </p><p> If you choose to use Schematics or Capture, the entire electrical or electronic circuit is placed on a drawing board (on the computer monitor) and you choose, from among the available options, the kind of analysis you would like to perform. The end result is the same as you would get if you went directly to the PSpice program. The choice to use PSpice directly or to let Schematics or Capture create the circuit file is yours to make. It should be pointed out that PSpice can become an effective tool in short order, while learning Schematics or Capture is much more tedious and involved. WHAT'S NEW IN THE FOURTH EDITION </p><p> As you might expect with the merger of MicroSim and OrCAD, the look and mechanics of PSpice are different from what was available in past versions of the software. The material for this edition is based on the evaluation software, version 9. This software (or a later version if available) is included with this text in the form of a CD-ROM. </p><p> Some familiarity with Microsoft Windows 95 or 98 by the reader is assumed. The installation of the software is described in Appendix C, or you may simply insert the CD-ROM and follow the directions on the screen. Either the OrCAD main menu will appear or you can use the Start, Run sequence followed by typing d:orcadstart.exe for the file name (where d is the letter assigned to your CD-ROM drive). </p><p> Chapters 1-13 cover most of the topics that are included in do and ac circuit analysis, semiconductor devices and circuits, operational amplifiers, two-port networks, and filters. Chapters 14-17 are devoted to the same topics using the tools available in Schematics. The appendices have been refined to reflect a wider availability of digital parts in the device libraries. </p><p> All the example problems have been reworked using Windows 98 and the latest available version of PSpice, and all the Probe traces have been revised to show the newer look of output files from Probe. There is little difference in the results most recently obtained and those obtained using earlier versions of the software. One difference is worth mentioning: Depending on the printer that you use, the plots obtained when using Probe will not look exactly alike. Generally speaking, the print drivers for laser printers produce the better results when compared with inkj</p><p> </p><ul> <li>Presents content in such a way that anyone who is studying or has studied the various electrical topics will be able immediately to put OrCad's PSpice to practical use.</li> <li>Gives full explanations of the example problems &#x2014; not just the abbreviated "how-to" coverage found in most other texts.</li> <li>Provides more insight than other texts into the creation and use of circuit models for OrCad's PSpice. </li></ul></p><h2>My Life on a Frozen Lake: Guide to the Twelve Steps of Recovery</h2><p>My Life on a Frozen Lake by Howard P is a guide to applying the twelve steps of substance abuse recovery.

The story of Claire Beauchamp Randall and Jamie Fraser seemed an obvious choice for a cinematic retelling, but the project was not without its logistical challenges. With the novel weighing in at more than 600 pages, the core dilemma always centered on how much of the action-�packed adventure would have to be cut just to fit the traditional cinematic window of two hours. With too much to lose to the proverbial cutting room floor, the world of Outlander remained strictly in the realm of print.<br><br> It wasn&#x2019;t until around 2010 that a possible solution started to present itself: a television series. Maril Davis, a development executive/co&#x2013;�executive producer for Ronald D. Moore&#x2019;s Tall Ship Productions, was looking for potential properties to produce and had the books recommended to her by friend and softball teammate Matthew B. Roberts.<br><br> &#x201c;[Roberts] had read the books as a reader during one of his first jobs,&#x201d; Davis explains. &#x201c;He passed on the books because they wanted to do movies but told me they would be great for TV. I took him up on that and read them all the way through.<br><br> &#x201c;I loved them,&#x201d; Davis says with unabashed adoration. &#x201c;This to me was my passion project.&#x201d;<br><br> But the television landscape at the time wasn&#x2019;t yet the haven for high-�concept sci-�fi series it seems to be today. &#x201c;Game of Thrones was not on at that point. Ron had tried to do Dragonriders of Pern. It just didn&#x2019;t feel like the timing was right.&#x201d;<br><br> Cut to a personal dinner Davis was having with Moore and his wife, Terry Dresbach, where the three started talking about the projects they had always longed to do. &#x201c;I said, &#x2018;My passion project is this book series called Outlander, and I would love to do them,&#x2019; &#x201d; Davis recalls. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t realize Terry was also a fan. So we talked, and Ron seemed intrigued.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Terry and I talked about it after the dinner a few times,&#x201d; Moore remembers. &#x201c;But it wasn&#x2019;t really until I sat down and started reading the book that I saw the potential.&#x201d; From that first read, he says, he was struck by how Gabaldon&#x2019;s writing kept surprising him. &#x201c;By the time I got to the end of the book, there had been some significant twists and turns that I didn&#x2019;t see coming. In my head, I could definitely see a season of television and how it works through a season. Plus the fact that, at that point, there were multiple books in the series just meant that it had a life beyond season one. I remember thinking, If the other books are anywhere near as good as this, then essentially I&#x2019;m in.&#x201d;<br><br> Davis was thrilled to get the go-�ahead to pursue. &#x201c;I got in touch with the rights holder, Jim Kohlberg. We had a great meeting, but it was very obvious that they wanted to do this book series as films.&#x201d; Davis left the meeting convinced a film would not do justice to the books. &#x201c;Reluctantly, we walked away,&#x201d; she says.<br><br> &#x201c;But I was like a dog with a bone,&#x201d; she continues, laughing. &#x201c;I just kept checking back every once in a while. One of the times, they were open to doing TV. So Ron and I went back in there and had a fabulous meeting, and it kind of started there.&#x201d;<br><br> Davis says they pitched Chris Parnell, executive vice president of Sony Pictures Television, to be their studio partner, but he was unfamiliar with the books. &#x201c;To his credit, Chris went out and bought the book on tape and listened in his car, which was so cute,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;He would call me every once in a while and be like, &#x2018;I am sitting in my car blushing,&#x2019; which was hilarious.&#x201d; By the book&#x2019;s end, Davis says, Parnell was on board and ready to champion the show to the networks.<br><br> The next step for Moore and Davis was to officially visit Gabaldon at her Scottsdale, Arizona, residence. &#x201c;Just from the fan perspective, not even a producer perspective, I felt it was so important to get her approval,&#x201d; Davis says. &#x201c;I wanted her approval and just to make sure she was comfortable that this book was in the right hands. I wanted to assure her that we weren&#x2019;t trying to exploit it and we understood what it was. There was Ron&#x2019;s track record, certainly as an amazing writer but also as someone who obviously writes very strong female characters, from Battlestar Galactica to Carniv�le. I also wanted her to know that I was going to protect the series as well, it being so close to my heart and near and dear to me.&#x201d;<br><br> For Gabaldon, having the books in serious development after so many years of thinking it couldn&#x2019;t work was beyond surprising. &#x201c;People are always asking, &#x2018;Why is it that you held out for Ron?&#x2019; The truth is that I didn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; she says with her trademark candor. &#x201c;We were very careful who we did options with, because there was always a possibility that they would succeed. In which case, you will never get the rights back. We had done this only four times and, luckily, none of the first three times took.&#x201d;<br><br> But it seemed an Outlander series was finally about to happen in earnest. Gabaldon recalls that she was very curious about the pair who made it happen. &#x201c;They came and spent two days with me at my house, talking over story lines, characters, and backstory. Asking had I written anything that wasn&#x2019;t in the books that they should be aware of? Where did I see the story going? Ron was sharing with me his vision of storytelling and what he thought of the characters. I could tell that we were pretty much on the same wavelength with regard to the importance of a central character in a story, which predisposed me to him.&#x201d;<br><br> Gabaldon was also impressed during those initial meetings by the clarity of the vision Moore had for the series. &#x201c;He began to share his own philosophy and his take on how things would work,&#x201d; she goes on. &#x201c;He said he would like to start [the series] with a little visual prologue that takes place before Outlander [the book] actually starts. He&#x2019;d show Claire during World War II in a military hospital out in France, saving people&#x2019;s lives. She is a central character, and we need to fix her in people&#x2019;s consciousness immediately as the main person of interest. And I am sort of nodding as he is saying all this and going, &#x2018;Yes. You are right.&#x2019; I could tell he did know what he was doing and I approved the direction he saw for doing it.<br><br> &#x201c;I gave them my blessing to start the script the way Ron wanted to,&#x201d; Gabaldon explains. A few days later, Moore sent over his pilot script. &#x201c;I told him when I read it, this is the only thing that I have ever read based on my own work that didn&#x2019;t make me turn white or burst into flames, so I was favorably impressed.&#x201d;<br><br> Moore says gaining Diana&#x2019;s favor gave them reassurance that they were taking the right direction with her work, which he felt was important given how devoted the series&#x2019; readers have proven themselves to be over the years. &#x201c;We really wanted to engage and keep the fan base that was already there from the books and transfer them over to the TV show,&#x201d; Moore explains. &#x201c;Diana had her finger on that pulse for many, many years. She knew them pretty intimately, communicated with them, and had a good sense of what was important to them. She was a good indicator of where we were. She kept us in the lane.&#x201d;<br><br> For Davis, Gabaldon&#x2019;s approval gave the series the ability to credibly move forward. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if we could have gone ahead, in my mind, without her approval in some way. We didn&#x2019;t technically need it, because obviously at that point we had secured the rights. But I think for me, having her approval and having her on board with what we were doing was incredibly important, and I don&#x2019;t think we could have done it without her.&#x201d;<br><br> Finding the right home for the show was the next step, which required the ever-�growing Team Outlander&#x2014;�at this point comprised of Davis, Moore, and Parnell as well as Sony executives Jamie Er�licht and Zack Van Amburg&#x2014;�to once again pitch the idea. But Davis says Starz impressed from the very first meeting. &#x201c;We would walk into every pitch meeting&#x2014;�me, Ron, the Sony executives&#x2014;�with this huge stack of [Diana&#x2019;s] books to show them how much material there was. Starz was the only place we went that they had actually read the first book and were the only ones that also said to us, &#x2018;We want you to stick to the books.&#x2019; &#x201d; Following that meeting, Outlander the television series was officially greenlit in November 2012 for development and a pilot.<br><br> Almost two years later, after hiring a writers&#x2019; room in Pasadena, California, setting up a transatlantic production in Scotland, and casting the characters readers had been picturing in their minds&#x2019; eyes for over two decades, Moore was able to share with Gabaldon the first footage of her world brought to life. Gabaldon remembers that it was behind the scenes at an Outlander fan event in January 2014 when Moore asked if she&#x2019;d like to take a look. &#x201c;I said, &#x2018;Yeah, I would.&#x2019; He had it on his laptop and we were all sitting back there on this ratty old sofa. He opened his laptop and that is where I saw the first few scenes of Outlander. I was totally fascinated. It was beautiful and it was terrific.&#x201d;<br><br> Just shy of twenty-�three years from when Gabaldon first put to paper her story about a woman traveling back in time through standing stones, that story was taking on a new form, as actors breathed life into the beloved characters and the vast beauty of Scotland served as its backdrop. Outlander, the series, takes the story of Claire Beauchamp Randall and James MacKenzie Fraser into a whole new realm, and in this book, that journey is our story. . . .&nbsp;</p><h2>Savage Dreams: A Journey into the Hidden Wars of the American West</h2><p>"A beautiful, absorbing, tragic book."&#x2015;Larry McMurtry<br> <br> In 1851, a war began in what would become Yosemite National Park, a war against the indigenous inhabitants.

Written in the second person, it's intense and immediately devourable. <em>Sous Chef</em> has all the drama, disaster, and triumph people have come to expect from reality restaurant TV, but far more intimate and nuanced. On every page, Gibney turns out phrases to savor: this is kitchen writing on par with Gabrielle Hamilton's <em>Blood, Bones &amp; Butter</em>. No one who&#x2019;s read Anthony Bourdain&#x2019;s <em>Kitchen Confidential</em> will be surprised by the more licentious elements, but the real thrills are those transcendent moments when every player is absorbed by their role, moving together to assemble a fantastic meal. In Gibney&#x2019;s hands, the anonymous act of preparing and serving great food to ravenous multitudes feels authentically noble, verging on heroic. <em>--Mari Malcolm</em></p>Michael Gibney began working in restaurants at the age of sixteen and assumed his first sous chef position at twenty-two.

Heather Paxson&#x2019;s beautifully written anthropological study of American artisanal cheesemaking tells the story of how craftwork has become a new source of cultural and economic value for producers as well as consumers. Dairy farmers and artisans inhabit a world in which their colleagues and collaborators are a wild cast of characters, including plants, animals, microorganisms, family members, employees, and customers. As &#x201c;unfinished&#x201d; commodities, living products whose qualities are not fully settled, handmade cheeses embody a mix of new and old ideas about taste and value. By exploring the life of cheese, Paxson helps rethink the politics of food, land, and labor today.</p><p>&#x201c;Paxson's book, like her subject matter, is lively, evocative, and masterfully crafted."&#x2015;Susanne Freidberg, author of <i>Fresh: A Perishable History</i><br><br>&#x201c;Through vivid storytelling, Heather Paxson advances a post-pastoral food ethos that reconsiders contemporary beliefs about America&#x2019;s food commerce and culture, reimagines our relationship to the natural world, and redefines how we make, eat, and appreciate food. For cheese aficionados, activists, and food scholars alike, reading <i>The Life of Cheese</i> will be a transformative experience.&#x201d;&#x2015;Amy Trubek, author of <i>The Taste of Place: A Cultural Journey into Terroir</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Life of Cheese</i> is the definitive work on America's artisanal food revolution.

A must read for anyone interested in fostering a sustainable food system.&#x201d;&#x2015;Warren Belasco, author of <i>Meals to Come: A History of the Future of Food</i><br><br>&#x201c;This vivid ethnography of contemporary artisan cheesemakers explores both the labor of hand crafting and the moral overtones of this calling. For those who participate, &#x2018;the life of cheese&#x2019; is indeed a calling in the spiritual or philosophic sense, entailing a journey through the biopolitical world of agribusiness, bacterial cultures, and the FDA.

Over the course of nearly a year, Steinberg accompanied admissions officer Ralph Figueroa on a tour to assess and recruit the most promising students in the country. <i>The Gatekeepers</i> follows a diverse group of prospective students as they compete for places in the nation's most elite colleges. The first book to reveal the college admission process in such behind-the-scenes detail, <i>The Gatekeepers</i> will be required reading for every parent of a high school-age child and for every student facing the arduous and anxious task of applying to college.<br><br>"[<i>The Gatekeepers</i>] provides the deep insight that is missing from the myriad how-to books on admissions that try to identify the formula for getting into the best colleges...I really didn't want the book to end."&nbsp;&#x2014;<i><b>The New York Times</b></i></p><p><b>Jacques Steinberg</b> has been a staff reporter for <i>The New York Times</i> for more than ten years and currently is a national education correspondent. In 1998, he was awarded the grand prize of the Education Writers Association for his nine-part series on a third-grade classroom on Manhattan's Upper West Side.One<br><br>The Tortilla Test<p>The lime-green Saturn raced along the winding roads of northern New Jersey, past trees strung with leaves that glowed tangerine, gold and maroon. But the driver was too preoccupied to notice the glorious foliage, his eyes continually darting to the passenger seat. There he had laid out travel directions printed from the Internet, along with a well-worn road atlas pocked with green asterisks spread across a half dozen states. Each designated a community that he had visited previously.</p><p>On that bracing morning in early November of 1999, Ralph Figueroa was beginning his fifth year as an admissions officer at Wesleyan University, in Middletown, Connecticut, one of the nation's premier liberal arts colleges. But from the vantage point of a passing driver, Ralph was just another motorist wearing a gray wool suit, white starched shirt and deep red tie. He sat hunched over the wheel of a rental car that was too small to contain his body, which unfolded to more than six feet and weighed well over two hundred pounds. With his thick, blown-back black hair, which he had neatly arranged at a Courtyard by Marriott just after daybreak, Ralph looked like someone on his way to sell a $350 vacuum cleaner, rather than the product of a $35,000-a-year education that came with the unwritten guarantee of a happy and meaningful life.</p><p>At ten-thirty, a few minutes early as usual, Ralph pulled up in front of Northern Valley Regional High School in Demarest, a boxy, tan-brick public school that looked nothing like the private Tudor-style academy that he had left a half hour before. This was his second sales call of the day, and one of four visits that he had scheduled within a fifty-mile radius. He had allotted just six hours for the day's work, so he would have to speak quickly. As he moved purposefully past green-tiled walls and gray lockers on the way to the guidance office, he fumbled to pin on a plastic badge embossed with his name and that of Wesleyan in big letters.</p><p>The popular image of university admissions officers is not unlike that of Hollywood studio executives. Both are assumed to spend most days sitting imperiously behind desks well out of reach of the general public, from which they deign to approve only a fraction of the endless series of pitches that are presented to them in rapid-fire succession. But to the handful of seniors and juniors who sat around a conference table that autumn morning listening to this smiling emissary on leave from his ivory tower, the message was unmistakable: Wesleyan Wants You! The university's gates, it seemed, had been flung wide open. And here, before their very eyes, was one of the gatekeepers who could escort them in.</p><p>From his seat beneath a giant map of the United States that a guidance counselor had labeled "College Acceptances"-so far, it had only one pin pushed into it, in the vicinity of Wilkes University in the Pocono Mountains-Ralph belied the familiar notion of admissions officer as intimidator. His voice was as soothing as a pediatrician's. He urged them to call him Ralph, not Rafael, his given name, and certainly not Mr. Figueroa.</p><p>The pitch Ralph delivered to his small audience seemed to promise that Wesleyan could fulfill virtually anyone's fantasy of higher education, if only the students would give the university the chance. And just to make sure that the students kept a vivid snapshot of the Connecticut campus projected on the screens in their minds, the university had sent along piles of posters of a Wesleyan landmark, Foss Hill, photographed on a fall day as beautiful as this one.</p><p>Even a devoted alumnus might not have noticed that the creaky football bleachers had been digitally removed, as had the many patches of brown dead turf. Instead, the late-fall grounds had the freshly tended appearance of the infield at Fenway Park. While the poster made a good first impression, some applicants would be disappointed when they saw the real thing. The curriculum, as described by Ralph, sometimes received a similar gloss.</p><p>"One of the first things to remember about the university is that there are no requirements," Ralph told the assembled group, tantalizing them with the prospect of never again having to take a dreaded subject like math or chemistry. "Wesleyan stresses a real-world approach."</p><p>Moreover, Ralph explained, while other institutions had begun only recently to appreciate and celebrate the differences among students, "We started our focus on diversity in 1965."</p><p>"That's the year I was born," he said, before adding that thirty-four years was indeed "a long time ago."</p><p>Almost immediately, the students' hands shot up. Would there be opportunities at Wesleyan to perform in a musical? one girl asked.</p><p>"Wesleyan does a lot of theater," Ralph responded. He mentioned that a first-string quarterback had played the lead in a recent production of Sweeney Todd, and that Wesleyan had a disproportionate share of alumni working in Hollywood. They included the writer of Batman Forever, the director of American Pie and the actor William Christopher, who, Ralph assured his listeners, would be well known to their parents as Father Mulcahy on M*A*S*H.</p><p>Just then a girl interrupted: Was the biology department any good?</p><p>"The physical sciences faculty does more research than just about any other liberal arts college," Ralph said. "Haverford beat us," he added. "But don't tell anyone."</p><p>Was there enough time for students at Wesleyan to study and to play sports?</p><p>"We want students to be scholar-athletes," Ralph said. Nearly two-thirds of Wesleyan undergraduates played an intramural or team sport. "The only thing that students do more of than sports at Wesleyan is community service."</p><p>How's the food?</p><p>One of the high school seniors, who had already visited a friend on the Wesleyan campus, answered before Ralph could. "There's always free frozen yogurt in the cafeteria," she said, describing the unique donation of a wealthy alumnus with a sweet tooth.</p><p>"Ice cream, too," Ralph added, sounding like Willie Wonka beckoning kids to the chocolate factory.</p><p>How fast are the Internet connections?</p><p>"Very fast," Ralph said.</p><p>Were there cable television jacks in the dorm rooms?</p><p>Ralph smiled. "There actually are," he said.</p><p>Only two questions drew answers that dimmed the Technicolor portrait that Ralph was painting that morning. But, then, an admissions officer from almost any other college would have had to give the same responses, if he or she was being honest.</p><p>One was posed by a serious-looking boy, who inquired: "Do you have any Nobel Prize winners on the faculty?"</p><p>"We don't have any Nobels," Ralph admitted, momentarily taken aback. "But we do have professors who have won Guggenheim and MacArthur and other grants."</p><p>The boy had been advised by his father, a Yale-educated ophthalmologist, to ask Ralph this question, and was obviously unimpressed.</p><p>The other tough question was a follow-up to Ralph's earlier point about diversity.<br>"Do the races mix?" he was asked.</p><p>"Yes and no," Ralph answered. Wesleyan had acquired nicknames like "PCU" and<br>"Diversity U" by attracting and admitting more black and Hispanic students than nearly any other top school, Ralph told his audience. "People think it's a place where students are holding hands and singing 'Kumbaya.' "</p><p>But, he had to acknowledge, "There is a tension. It's a process to address these issues and forge a community. Students will mix together one moment, only to segregate afterward."</p><p>And then, nearly an hour after his sales call had begun, it was over.</p><p>After making a note to contact the campus rabbi on behalf of one student, and passing out business cards with his e-mail address to several others, Ralph was back in his rental car and on his way to the next group of potential customers: a high school in the neighboring community of Ridgewood. He had spoken too long, and as he turned right onto Oradell Avenue, he was going to have to rush to make it on time.</p><p>But in all the talking he had done at Northern Valley Regional High, Ralph had neglected to mention a fact that the students surely would have found relevant: Wesleyan had just come off a year in which it had attracted a record number of applicants. Nearly 7000 students had sought the 715 spots available in the freshman class-almost 10 applicants for each seat. Though the university had offered admission to more than 715, because some of those accepted would invariably choose to go elsewhere, Wesleyan had still rejected 7 of every 10 who applied. The median SAT score of those admitted-a combined 1370 on a scale of 1600-was not only the highest in Wesleyan's history, but also higher than that of all but a handful of other colleges.</p><p>And as Ralph spoke, two months before all applications were due, there were already indications that this year would be even more competitive, with thousands more students projected to graduate from American high schools than in the previous school year. Rather than spend six weeks of the fall on the road courting applicants, as Ralph and his eight other colleagues from the admissions office were doing, they could easily have stayed home and still assembled a stellar class-several classes, in fact, given the pool of highly qualified applicants. But like a politician wading into a room full of strangers, Ralph and his colleagues were not going to rest until they had given every last college applicant a reason to cast a vote for Wesleyan.</p><p>Ralph had a particular voter in mind. He was hoping to seize the imagination of that elusive senior who hadn't given Wesleyan much thought, if he or she had given it any thought at all, but who appeared to have credentials so impeccable as to fairly sail through the admissions process. Ralph knew, though, that in his quest to find such a prize he was inviting most of his listeners to submit a fifty-five-dollar application fee sheerly for the privilege of being rejected.</p><p>"You realize that, further down the line, a lot of these kids will end up applying and being denied," Ralph said later. "But you can't really think about that at this stage. This stage is about figuring out which students should be considering Wesleyan, which students really need to have us on their radar screens. At this stage, I want everyone who could possibly benefit from Wesleyan to have that chance. They'll never get in if they don't try."</p><p>That may seem like a cute way to do business, but at the very moment that Ralph and his colleagues were fanning across the country and around the world, admissions officers from four dozen other highly selective colleges-including Harvard and Haverford, Swarthmore and Stanford, Princeton and Pomona-were spending tens of thousands of dollars, and hundreds of hours, on similar expeditions. Like Wesleyan, each had received a record or near-record number of applicants the previous winter. Nonetheless, each was intent on assembling a class that was a little bit better than last year's-and, if possible, a little bit better than almost every other institution's. As Ralph and his colleagues saw it, so worthy was the goal of putting together such a community that it justified the difficult and sometimes cruel practicalities that were required to make it happen.<br>In recent years, the elite colleges had become something like combatants in a global arms race, a contest in which strength would be measured by stockpiles of candidates arranged by test scores, grade point averages, outside interests and skin color. None of the institutions was willing to be the first to stand down and pronounce itself content with its lot.</p><p>"No one is staying static," said Barbara-Jan Wilson, who had left the deanship of the Wesleyan admissions office over the previous summer to become the university's vice president for university relations, which meant she had gone from sweet-talking applicants to sweet-talking donors.</p><p>"Schools under us are trying to pick off the kids in our applicant pool," she explained, ticking off college names like Trinity, Bates, Muhlenberg and Connecticut. "Meanwhile, we're trying to pick off Brown's kids and Yale's kids."<br>"Maybe we're just keeping up with the Joneses," she added. "But it's bigger than that."</p><p>In truth, Wesleyan was part of a distinct minority within the academy that fall: one of only about fifty American colleges that reject more students than they accept. The lion's share of the nation's two thousand four-year colleges take almost anyone who applies. Yet each year, an increasing number of American teenagers flood those brand-name institutions with a disproportionate number of applications. One explanation for this, apart from the larger student population, surely lies with their parents, who were impressing ever more strongly on their offspring that a blue-chip education is the key to a successful life. First- and second-generation Americans, whose own parents had been content to see them graduate from any college, were now advising their own children and grandchildren that only a marquee name would be acceptable. In addition, elaborate online tours were now making it possible for students and parents from as far away as Wyoming and New Mexico to roam the academic epicenter of the northeast without ever leaving home.</p><p>A university is only as good as its students, so why shouldn't Ralph seek to lure the best that were out there? Those turned back from the Wesleyan gate would surely find a place elsewhere, a fact in which Ralph took great comfort. More important, since Harvard and Yale and Brown were rejecting more applicants than ever, Wesleyan had a real shot at getting some students whom it might have lost to the Ivies a decade ago-if only enough of them knew Wesleyan's name and philosophy, and could be persuaded to choose Wesleyan over its more immediate competitors, including Williams and Amherst.</p><p>Other than those fortunate enough to be accepted, the most immediate beneficiaries of all this wooing would be Wesleyan's professors. Like gardeners, the university's faculty members needed fertile minds in which to plant the seeds of knowledge, and when they weren't satisfied with the quality in a given year-if there were too few Russian majors or not enough budding microbiologists, for example-the professors were never shy about telling the administration. Also paying close attention to Ralph's efforts were the university's alumni, who were particularly gratified when Wesleyan snared a hot prospect-academic, as well as athletic-from a competitor. That swelling pride was often all it took to nudge a willing alumnus to contribute upward of a million dollars to his alma mater, which in turn made it possible for the institution to seek to attract even better applicants.</p><p>But in building its arsenal of top students-with "top" variously defined as those who checked "valedictorian" on their applications; those with decent test scores who identified themselves as black or Hispanic; or those who played the bassoon-Wesleyan was also seeking to impress demanding audiences far from its Connecticut campus.</p><p>For the last two decades, much of the pressure on admissions officers like Ralph had been applied by a group of observers who had assigned themselves the task of rating universitie...</p></p><h2>Introduction to Emergency Management</h2><p><p>Emergency management university programs have experienced dramatic and exponential growth over the last twelve years.

Shinn, a well-known artist in his time, was a popular illustrator of newspapers and magazines whose work displayed a remarkable affinity for the stories of Charles Dickens, evoking the bustling street life of the mid-1800s. Printed on heavy, cream-colored paper stock, the edges of the pages have been left rough, simulating the way in which the story might have appeared in Dickens's own time.

With this book the experiences of the men on the water come to the forefront and deepen our understanding of the long and bitter struggle. This 50th anniversary commemorative volume documents the crucial part played by the sea services in the invasion through a series of eyewitness narratives remarkable for their variety and candor. No longer a mere footnote to history, the indispensable role of the sea services can finally be fully appreciated.<br>To provide a vivid, memorable account of the June 1944 Allied assault on Normandy, Paul Stillwell has selected four dozen firsthand recollections of the participants, illustrated with some 250 photographs, many from private collections. Taken from interviews he and other oral historians have conducted, the recollections range from those of admirals in command to frontline soldiers and capture the human side of the story from all perspectives. The drama, sense of sacrifice, and impact on individuals are realized through the reminiscences of naval reservist Douglas Fairbanks Jr., former Brooklyn Dodger Rex Barney, and Medal of Honor recipient Vice Adm. John D. Bulkeley, USN (Ret.), who commanded the minesweepers that cleared the sea-lanes to the Normandy beaches, and a host of other participants.<br>Assault on Normandy also recounts the fatal flight of Joseph Kennedy, conditions on board troop transports and landing craft, the capture of hundreds of German prisoners, PT-boat operations, the naval shore bombardment of Normandy and Cherbourg, a surface gun battle at point-blank range, and the use of codebreaking in the air war.

A victim of emotional and sexual abuse at the hands of her first husband, she made it her life's work to ensure that other women were better informed about their bodies and their opportunities than she had been. After leaving her first husband, she became a national figure in the 1840s and '50s by giving anatomy lectures around the country, attended by thousands of women, in which she openly discussed the needs, details, and desires of the female body. With her second husband, medical writer and social reformer Thomas Low Nichols, she embarked on an unprecedented intellectual and professional collaboration, and together they challenged the inequities of conventional marriage, demanded the right of every woman to have control over her body, and advocated universal good health.</p><p>Considered too radical and mercurial even by their fellow reformers, especially after their conversion to Catholicism, Mary and her husband were often excluded from the very social causes they had helped to found&#x2013;just as they have been from the histories of their era. In <i>Shameless</i>, Jean Silver-Isenstadt offers the first biography of this remarkable woman who paved the way for such activists as Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Margaret Sanger. Drawing on the extensive public and private writings of the Nicholses and their peers, Silver-Isenstadt vividly portrays Mary Gove Nichols' courageous life and visionary intellect, revealing the rich diversity of opinion within nineteenth-century America's social reform movements and uncovering the inspiring story of a woman who dared to live by the utopian principles she advocated.</p></p><p><p>Biography of the influential but now-forgotten 19th-century American social reformer who preached equality in marriage, free love, and the cold-water cure.</p>"First-time biographer Silver-Isenstadt carves a space in the annals of feminist social activists, health reformers, and sex educators for Mary Gove Nichols, a forgotten radical thinker who cleared the trail for Margaret Sanger and Dr. Ruth Westheimer. Precocious, spiritual-minded, and free-thinking . . . she found her soulmate in her second husband, Thomas Nichols, a journalist turned doctor and an ardent feminist. Together they zealously espoused their belief in the connection between health, sexual liberation, and freedom; founded a school; dabbled in spiritualism; then unexpectedly converted to Catholicism. The Nichols' [Mary and her husband Thomas] story is complex, fascinating and relevant, and Silver-Isenstadt elucidates their lives and ideas with nimble insight and verve." -Booklist <p>"Shameless is a terrific book, a compelling and brilliantly written narrative of the life, times, and works of the little known nineteenth-century educator and reformer Mary Gove Nichols. Nichols was well ahead of her time on a wide variety of issues&#x2014;mainly women's issues&#x2014;and it is satisfying to see her finally getting credit for her courageous work on women's health, on modern marriage, on sexuality, and on community. This book is an eye-opener; it has wonderful descriptions of the water cure, of utopian communes, and of nineteenth century marriages ranging from awful to great. Many well-known figures&#x2014;Emerson, Fuller, Poe, Whitman, Horace Greeley, Henry James Sr. and Frances Osgood appear as well. This is also a love story. Jean Silver-Isenstadt has written a splendid biography. The vivid narrative is driven by historical fact, responsibly documented and enriched by cultural theory. The result is altogether as attractive as a good novel."&#x2014;Robert D. Richardson, author of Henry Thoreau: A Life of the Mind and Emerson: The Mind on Fire </p><p>"A pleasure to read. This is the story of Mary Gove Nichols and her second husband, Thomas Low Nichols, nineteenth-century reformers who dabbled in everything from health reform to free love." &#x2014;Ronald L. Numbers, University of Wisconsin, author of Prophetess of Health: A Study of Ellen G. White</p></p><h2>Creating Worlds, Constructing Meaning: The Scottish Storyline Method (Teacher to Teacher)</h2><p><p><i>Creating Worlds, Constructing Meaning</i> is the first U.S. book on Storyline, a revolutionary method for teaching content, integrating curriculum, and engaging students. Developed in Scotland over thirty years ago and now used in over a dozen countries, the Storyline method uses the power of story to create a meaningful, real-life context through which students learn concepts and skills. Students and teacher work collaboratively to create a setting and characters; plot evolves as they address real problems and issues that arise. A creative partnership is established between the teacher and learners as they share and explore ideas and feelings. </p> <p>This book follows the development of the Storyline method in Jeff Creswell's elementary classroom over a period of four years. The author offers a history of the method and five specific examples of Storylines he and his students have created. All of the activities involve more than one subject and advance students' knowledge and skill in more than one area. Language and mathematical skills find application in environmental studies; art, drama, and music play a part in social studies and geography. The lines between discrete curriculum areas blur as students explore topics and apply skills in this innovative approach to curriculum integration. </p> <p>In the eight years since Storyline was brought to the United States, it has been embraced by teachers and administrators working with children from preschool through high school. This book will be a valuable reference tool for teachers already familiar with the method as well those who want to learn more about it. </p></p><p><p>Jeff Creswell has been teaching elementary school and presenting workshops around the world for twenty years. He has worked with teachers using the Storyline method since it was first brought to the United States in 1990.</p></p><h2>Introduction to Health Care in a Flash!: An Interactive, Flash-Card Approach</h2><p><p><strong>Text</strong></p><br><ul><br> <li>Coverage focuses on...communication, cultural sensitivity, human body basics, assessing patients, ethical and legal aspects, and how to successfully land a job.</li><br> <li>More than 60 full-color drawings and photographs illustrate important tasks, procedures, diseases, and disorders.</li><br> <li>&#x201c;Stop, Think, and Learn&#x201d; case studies foster critical-thinking skills.</li><br> <li>&#x201c;Flashpoint&#x201d; boxes summarize and clarify key concepts.</li><br></ul><br><p><strong><br><br>BONUS CD-ROM</strong></p><br><ul><br> <li>Interactive exercises including...<br> <ul><br> <li>Word Search</li><br> <li>Crosswords</li><br> <li>Don&#x2019;t Tip the Scale</li><br> <li>Memory Mania</li><br> <li>Flash Cards</li><br> </ul><br> </li><br></ul><br><p><strong>Online at Davis<em>Plus</em></strong></p><br><ul><br> <li>320 full-color, printable flash cards</li><br> <li>Fun activities</li><br></ul></p><p></p><h2>The Writer&#39;s Digest Character Naming Sourcebook</h2><p>Lists more than 20,000 first and last names and their meanings, and includes advice on choosing appropriate names for specific genres</p><p>Sherrilyn Kenyon is the <i>USA Today</i> and <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of several series, including <i>The Dark-Hunters</i>, <i>Brotherhood of the Sword</i>, <i>The MacAllisters</i>, <i>Sex Camp Diaries</i> and <i>BAD Boys</i>.

In the town of Pompeii tradesmen removed the shutters from their shops and hung up their merchandise. Lunch was being prepared in the laundry of Stephanus. A group of gladiators met in a bar. Moedestus, the baker, stocked his oven and carefully placed the dough alongside the flames. Suddenly the air was split by a resounding crash and the ground shook. People rushed into the streets. The sky became overcast and darkness descended. Within hours Pompeii and a number of other towns were buried under several meters of pumice and ashes. This was the greatest natural disaster in European history."<br> From the remarkable pen of Peter Connolly comes a comprehensive look at the ancient city of Pompeii. He begins with the scientific facts: How was Pompeii destroyed? How did Mount Vesuvius become an active volcano? What happened during the erruption? How long did Pompeii lay buried and forgotten and how was it finally rediscovered? What was Pompeii's history before the disaster?<br> Then, Peter Connolly does what he does better than anyone--he rebuilds the past in words and pictures, allowing us to imagine what it was like to live in old Pompeii. Like an archaeological detective, he sifts through the ruins and artifacts to reconstruct one area of the town in minute detail. With maps and cross-sections, photographs, drawings, and an engrossing and fact-filled text, Connolly takes us into the very homes of its citizens--into the kitchens, atriums, bedrooms and out into the gardens. We learn what the furniture looked like, how the homes were lighted and heated, what kind of jewellry was popular, and what the gladiators wore. We view the varied styles of architecture and decoration, attend a grand dinner party, visit local shops, go to the theatre, to a public bath, and to the gladiators' arena. We gain an understanding of this ancient civilization, and begin to see how much was lost when the city fell prey to the million of tons of lava and ashes that fell on it during the devastating disaster.<br> The story of Pompeii is one of the most terrible and fascinating in history. Connolly brings it alive for children, adding another distingished volume to Oxford's <em>Rebuilding the Past</em> series.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>Peter Connolly</strong> has written and illustrated many books for children about the Ancient World, including the award-winning <em>Legend of Odysseus</em>. He is an honorary research fellow of the Institute of Archaeology in London.<br>Grade 6-8-- Full-color photographs and illustrations and detailed sketches grace every page of this entry in an already crowded field of books on the subject. Detailed drawings of houses, shops, and public buildings such as baths, theatres, and temples in their original conditions help readers understand the day to day workings of a Roman town in the first century a.d. Particularly striking are the full-page cutaways of buildings. Each subject is addressed in a two-page layout. Such prosaic details as sewage systems and laundering techniques are given as much attention as gladiator games and drama. The accompanying text is sometimes a bit technical, and some Latin terms are not fully explained. A careful introduction illuminates not only the eruption, but also the early history of the city and the surrounding area. This is as complete and thorough a documentation of the story of Pompeii as any that can currently be found in children's collections. --David N.

In the first part of this unique volume, the chapters give an overview of both traditional and new methodological approaches to the use of sources, analyzing the way that these have changed over time. The second part gives an overview of twelve different types of written sources, including letters, opinion polls, surveillance reports, diaries, novels, newspapers, and dreams, taking into account the huge expansion in the range of written primary sources used by historians over the last thirty years. This book is an up-to-date introduction into the historical context of these different genres, the ways they should be read, the possible insights and results these sources offer and the pitfalls of their interpretation.

Laruelle, who was born in 1937, has recently gained widespread recognition, and Alexander R. Galloway suggests that readers may benefit from colliding Laruelle&#x2019;s concept of the One with its binary counterpart, the Zero, to explore more fully the relationship between philosophy and the digital. </p><p>In <i>Laruelle</i>, Galloway argues that the digital is a philosophical concept and not simply a technical one, employing a detailed analysis of Laruelle to build this case while referencing other thinkers in the French and Continental traditions, including Alain Badiou, Gilles Deleuze, Martin Heidegger, and Immanuel Kant. In order to explain clearly Laruelle&#x2019;s concepts such as the philosophical decision and the principle of sufficient philosophy, Galloway lays a broad foundation with his discussions of &#x201c;the One&#x201d; as it has developed in continental philosophy, the standard model of philosophy, and how philosophers view &#x201c;the digital.&#x201d;</p><p>Digital machines dominate today&#x2019;s world, while so-called digital thinking&#x2014;that is, binary thinking such as presence and absence or self and world&#x2014;is often synonymous with what it means to think at all. In examining Laruelle and digitality together, Galloway shows how Laruelle remains a profoundly non-digital thinker&#x2014;perhaps the only non-digital thinker today&#x2014;and engages in an extensive discussion on the interconnections between media, philosophy, and technology. <br></p></p><p><p>Alexander Galloway is professor of media, culture, and communication at New York University.

Richards focuses on the development of evolutionary theories of mind and behavior from their first distinct appearance in the eighteenth century to their controversial state today. Particularly important in the nineteenth century were Charles Darwin's ideas about instinct, reason, and morality, which Richards considers against the background of Darwin's personality, training, scientific and cultural concerns, and intellectual community. Many critics have argued that the Darwinian revolution stripped nature of moral purpose and ethically neutered the human animal. Richards contends, however, that Darwin, Herbert Spencer, and their disciples attempted to reanimate moral life, believing that the evolutionary process gave heart to unselfish, altruistic behavior.<br> <br> "Richards's book is now the obvious introduction to the history of ideas about mind and behavior in the nineteenth century."&#x2014;Mark Ridley, Times Literary Supplement<br> <br> "Not since the publication of Michael Ghiselin's <i>The Triumph of the Darwinian Method</i> has there been such an ambitious, challenging, and methodologically self-conscious interpretation of the rise and development and evolutionary theories and Darwin's role therein."&#x2014;John C. Greene, <i>Science</i><br> <br> "His book . . . triumphantly achieves the goal of all great scholarship: it not only informs us, but shows us why becoming thus informed is essential to understanding our own issues and projects."&#x2014;Daniel C. Dennett, <i>Philosophy of Science<br> <br></i></p></p><p>This book traces the development of evolutionary theories of mind and behavior from their first distinctive appearance in the 18th century to their controverted state in the present.<b>Robert J.

You'll learn the differences between common stock, bond, money market, and balanced funds, and why a passively managed "index" fund is a smarter investment than a fund managed by someone making weighted bets on individual securities, sectors, and the economy.

Bogle, founder of the Vanguard Group of Investment Companies, has built a $100 billion mutual fund company on principles of candor, fairness, and low cost. The most outspoken critic of the mutual fund industry, Bogle speaks to the serious mutual fund investor, both novice and seasoned, in this straightforward assessment of an industry Bogle himself helped revolutionize. Here he offers the essential principles of canny mutual fund investing, as well as caveats to protect the investor. Readers will learn how to: Ask three critical questions before investing. Evaluate risk tolerance and design a portfolio to meet current financial objectives. Develop a diversified portfolio of equity funds, bonds, and money market funds that will weather the market's short term variations.

Anyone who is serious about mutual funds can apply the dynamic investment principles of <i>Bogle On Mutual Funds</i> to establish a winning, long-term investment portfolio. <p>"Bogle is rattling the status quo among the mutual fund titans." -- <i>Fortune</i></p><p>John Bogle--investment giant and founder of the Vanguard Group of mutual funds--offers a hands-on guide for creating a long-term investment program that can be tailored to any investor's financial goals. Written in down-to-earth terms for investors at any level, <i>Bogle on Mutual Funds: New Perspectives for the Intelligent Investor</i> explores the rewards of investing, the inherent investment risks, and the pitfalls to avoid. Drawing on his years of investment wisdom and success, Bogle outlines the time-tested principles and practicalities of investing through mutual funds. </p><p>At the heart of Bogle's analysis are three "New Perspectives" on key investment issues. When the first edition of <i>Bogle on Mutual Funds</i> was published in 1993, these topics had not been given much attention in financial literature. Today, however, these ideas are firmly in the mainstream of investing's conventional wisdom. Those three new perspectives--index funds, mutual fund costs, and taxes and mutual funds-- remain critically important topics for mutual fund investors to consider. Bogle shows the way to intelligently navigate these issues in order to maximize your chances for investment success. </p><p>Bogle's approach to mutual fund investing offers an effective method for developing a broadly diversified investment program. Step by step, he shows how to develop a long-term and strategic investing approach that balances the myriad market risks and shows how to manage the bumps along the volatile road of the marketplace. With Bogle on your side, you can learn how to spot excessive fees, reduce taxes, steer clear of overblown advertising claims, and ultimately create a portfolio that will meet your own financial objectives. </p><p><i>Bogle on Mutual Funds</i> gives investors the keys to adopting an effective asset allocation strategy, selecting appropriate mutual funds, and employing the savvy use of index funds. Fundamental to the Bogle approach is an understanding of the role of the many costs of investing, including advisory fees, operating expenses, and sales charges. Return, risk, and cost are the three legs of Bogle's eternal triangle of investing. </p><p>John Bogle has built his acclaimed mutual fund company on the fundamental principles of candor, fairness, and low cost. <i>Bogle on Mutual Funds: New Perspectives for the Intelligent Investor</i>, his first book, has become a classic. The framework it presents for creating an investment portfolio is well grounded in Bogle's fact-founded wisdom and guiding principles, proven over and over again during the near-quarter-century since its first publication in 1993.</p></p><h2>John (4) (Zondervan Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament)</h2><p><p>This series is designed for those who know biblical languages.

Still one of the most dreaded diseases to haunt our imaginations, cancer is more than an illness - it is a cultural phenomenon. People who have cancer are bombarded with competing explanations of their conditions: it is genetically inherited; it is environmentally produced; it is the result of their personality. <em>Teratologies - A Cultural Study of Cancer</em> investigates how this disease is perceived, experienced and theorised in contemporary society. It explores changing beliefs about the causes of, and the cures for, cancer in both biomedicine and its increasingly popular alternative counterparts.<br>Analysing conventional and alternative medical accounts, self-help manuals and patients' personal stories, Jackie Stacey takes a critical look at the place of heroes, metaphors, the self and the body in these competing bids to produce the authoritative definition of the meaning of cancer today. Interspersed with these detailed textual investigations are discussions of broader issues such as the feminist debates about the history of science, the place of consumer culture in health practices and the status of patients and of health professionals in postmodern society.<br>Combining authobiographical narratives with contemporary theoretical debates, the author carves out a specifically feminist analysis of the cultural dimensions of cancer. She brings accounts of her own illness under the critical lens of academic scrutiny and situates these personal stories within a discussion of contemporary cultural change.</p><p>Jackie Stacey is Lecturer in Sociology at Lancaster University."This book is at once a personal narrative of a woman who faced her own cancerous 'monsters' and a scholarly analysis of philosophy, sociology, and anthropology in light of the various approaches to health care, most specifically, the care of a person with cancer....

The subsequent investigation was a maze of politics, bizarre theories, and shrouded answers. Bill Adair, an award-winning journalist, was granted special access to the five-year inquiry by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) while its investigators tried to determine if the world&#39;s most widely used commercial jet, the Boeing 737, was really safe.</p><p><b>Bill Adair</b> covers aviation, national politics, and Congress for the <i>St. Petersburg Times</i>. He has won numerous awards, including the Sigma Delta Chi Award for Washington correspondence.In 1994, a Boeing 737 operated by USAir suddenly and inexplicably nosed over and went into an uncontrollable dive. In 28 seconds, some 132 people died. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators worked for five years to determine the cause. While NTSB, the FAA, Boeing, the pilots' union, and the airline pursued the engineering issues, survivors and lawyers pursued the personal need for closure, revenge, and compensation. Each party had its own agenda, and orchestrating the many voices over a lengthy and frustrating investigation was difficult. Adair, a writer for the St. Petersburg Times, closely follows the investigation as it creates and discards hundreds of theories, from bird impact to Mafia assassination. He dissects the enormously complicated investigation and ably explains the many competing issues that make aircraft disasters so difficult to bring to closure. His examination of the behind-the-scenes work that shapes airline safety policy is detailed and absorbing. Recommended for aeronautics, public policy, and journalism collections. Edwin B.

The United States Navy was blockaded in port; much of the army had not been paid for nearly a year; the capital had been burned. The treaty offered an unexpected escape from disaster. Yet it incensed Monroe, for the name of Great Britain and its negotiators consistently appeared before those of the United States. "The United States have acquired a certain rank amongst nations, which is due to their population and political importance," he brazenly scolded the British diplomat who conveyed the treaty, "and they do not stand in the same situation as at former periods." <br><br>Monroe had a point, writes Troy Bickham. In <em>The Weight of Vengeance</em>, Bickham provides a provocative new account of America's forgotten war, underscoring its significance for both sides by placing it in global context. The Napoleonic Wars profoundly disrupted the global order, from India to Haiti to New Orleans. Spain's power slipped, allowing the United States to target the Floridas; the Haitian slave revolt contributed to the Louisiana Purchase; fears that Britain would ally with Tecumseh and disrupt the American northwest led to a pre-emptive strike on his people in 1811. This shifting balance of power provided the United States with the opportunity to challenge Britain's dominance of the Atlantic world. And it was an important conflict for Britain as well. Powerful elements in the British Empire so feared the rise of its former colonies that the British government sought to use the War of 1812 to curtail America's increasing maritime power and its aggressive territorial expansion. And by late 1814, Britain had more men under arms in North America than it had in the Peninsular War against Napoleon, with the war with America costing about as much as its huge subsidies to European allies. <br><br>Troy Bickham has given us an authoritative, lucidly written global account that transforms our understanding of this pivotal war.<br></p><p><br><strong>Troy Bickham</strong> is a Professor of History at Texas A&amp;M University. He is the author of <em>Making Headlines: The American Revolution as Seen Through the British Press</em> and <em>Savages within the Empire</em>.<br>"A well-researched work, Bickham's book places the conflict in a transatlantic framework, comparing and contrasting British and American motivations, attitudes, and perceptions." --Journal of Colonialism and Colonial History<br><br>"Bickham accomplishes a lot in this volume...Well written and occasionally provocative. Highly recommended." --CHOICE<br><br>"A provocative, behind-the-scenes look at the machinations of empires, this excellent history will appeal to all interested readers." - Library Journal<br><br>"[Bickham] argues rightly that the war involved a commercial struggle within the Atlantic world as well as a struggle to dominate North America. Behind the ostensible casus belli - e.g., the impressment of sailors from American ships by the Royal Navy - was a clash between America's expansion and Britain's efforts to avenge an earlier defeat by making a former colony a client state." - The Wall Street Journal<br><br>"Authoritative, up-to-date, and readable... Modern scholarship at its very best." - The Weekly Standard<br><br>"Densely-researched and fascinating ... If the American Revolution was fought for a national existence, the War of 1812 was fought for a national validity - the "certain rank" James Monroe invoked in dealings with the fractious British diplomats who sought to codify the new nation as a permanent junior partner on the world stage. The fight for that rank was carried out far more importantly in the press of the day than on the limited battlefields of the war itself, and Bickham, by exploring that fight, has made an invaluable contribution to our understanding of Mr. Madison's War." - OpenLetters Monthly<br><br>"Through eight chapters of lively narrative that alternate between the perspectives of Britain and those of the United States, Bickham stays true to his central premise that the United States fought the War of 1812 to force Britain to respect American national sovereignty, while the British fought to maintain the right to ignore it." Bic</p><h2>The Wave Function: Essays on the Metaphysics of Quantum Mechanics</h2><p>This is a new volume of original essays on the metaphysics of quantum mechanics. The essays address questions such as: What fundamental metaphysics is best motivated by quantum mechanics? What is the ontological status of the wave function? Does quantum mechanics support the existence of any other fundamental entities, e.g. particles? What is the nature of the fundamental space (or space-time manifold) of quantum mechanics? What is the relationship between the fundamental ontology of quantum mechanics and ordinary, macroscopic objects like tables, chairs, and persons? This collection includes a comprehensive introduction with a history of quantum mechanics and the debate over its metaphysical interpretation focusing especially on the main realist alternatives.<br></p><p><br><strong>Alyssa Ney</strong> is Associate Professor of Philosophy at the University of Rochester. She works primarily in metaphysics.<br><br><strong>David Z Albert</strong> is the author of <em>Quantum Mechanics and Experience</em> and <em>Time and Chance</em> and has published many articles on quantum mechanics, mostly in the <em>Physical Review</em>. He is Frederick E. Woodbridge Professor of Philosophy and Director of the M.A. Program in The Philosophical Foundations of Physics at Columbia University.<br><br>"This is an uncommonly good collection of essays on the metaphysical foundations of quantum mechanics. It contains work on a compelling subject from a number of the most engaging philosophers of physics, and the overall standard of clarity is exceptional."--Jeffrey A. Barrett, <em>Notre Dame</em> <em>Philosophical Reviews</em><p></p><br>"The wave function is perhaps the central representational tool that quantum physics uses to describe the world. But just what sort of physical reality does it represent? For too long, a physics too infected by instrumentalist tendencies ignored this question; but in recent decades, it has, happily, come to be viewed as absolutely central to a proper understanding of quantum physics. <em>The Wave Function</em> features ten commissioned essays by some of the sharpest physicists and philosophers working on this topic, framed by a masterful and comprehensive introductory essay that will make this volume readily accessible, even to the non-specialist. Wondering how to make sense of what quantum physics says about the world? Curious about the multifarious metaphysical and epistemological implications of what it says? Then this volume is for you."--Ned Hall, Department of Philosophy, Harvard University<p></p><br>"...the book is an excellent and enjoyable piece of philosophy, as one gets to see a single problem attacked from many distinct and compelling perspectives.

It develops basic concepts and techniques and brings together a sampling of their uses for solving problems arising in queueing, reliability, inventory and computer communications, social and behavioral processes, and business management and time series analysis. The book can be divided into two broad sections. Chapters 1 through 9 treat the theory of Markov, renewal, and stationary processes. Chapters 10 through 21 deal with applications and include six new chapters. In addition to the incorporation of new material in all chapters, major changes in the first half include: the consolidation of the chapter on two-state Markov processes with the chapter on Finite Markov Chains; a new section on graph theoretic methods; new chapters on time-dependent and limiting behavior and on special topics and inference in finite Markov chains; the expansion of the material on stationary processes to include ergodic theorems, spectral density, and linear filters; and the addition of over 200 exercises in the first nine chapters, with answers at the end of the book. Completely new chapters in the second half of the book include: queueing networks, communication and information systems, inventory and storage processes, combat models, Markov models in biological sciences, and stochastic models in traffic flow theory and geological sciences. In addition, the chapter on time series analysis has been updated and expanded, and has been moved to the end of the book to maintain the continuity of treatment of similar models. Elements of Applied Stochastic Processes, 2nd Edition is useful as a classroom text for industrial and systems engineering, operations research, statistics, business, economics, mathematics, and computer science students.

Forty years later, Phoenix had blossomed into a metropolis of 1.5 million people and the territory of the Navajo Nation was home to two of the largest strip mines in the world. Five coal-burning power plants surrounded the reservation, generating electricity for export to Phoenix, Los Angeles, and other cities. Exploring the postwar developments of these two very different landscapes, <i>Power Lines</i> tells the story of the far-reaching environmental and social inequalities of metropolitan growth, and the roots of the contemporary coal-fueled climate change crisis.</p><p>Andrew Needham explains how inexpensive electricity became a requirement for modern life in Phoenix&#x2015;driving assembly lines and cooling the oppressive heat. Navajo officials initially hoped energy development would improve their lands too, but as ash piles marked their landscape, air pollution filled the skies, and almost half of Navajo households remained without electricity, many Navajos came to view power lines as a sign of their subordination in the Southwest. Drawing together urban, environmental, and American Indian history, Needham demonstrates how power lines created unequal connections between distant landscapes and how environmental changes associated with suburbanization reached far beyond the metropolitan frontier. Needham also offers a new account of postwar inequality, arguing that residents of the metropolitan periphery suffered similar patterns of marginalization as those faced in America's inner cities.</p><p>Telling how coal from Indian lands became the fuel of modernity in the Southwest, <i>Power Lines</i> explores the dramatic effects that this energy system has had on the people and environment of the region.</p></p><p><p>"Rarely does a work of history unite so many seemingly disconnected fields of inquiry in such new and exciting ways. Masterfully interweaving urban, Native American, and environmental history, <i>Power Lines</i> is a sobering assessment of Phoenix's expansive postwar development. The legacies of the region's coal-powered history continue to shape contemporary politics, spaces, and our shared environmental future, making <i>Power Lines</i> as timely as it is insightful."<b>--Ned Blackhawk, Yale University</b></p><p>"What is the price of power? In modern America, the answer, as Needham reveals in this pioneering book, is heartbreaking. After reading <i>Power Lines</i>, one will never think about cities, Native Americans, or even the simple act of switching on the air conditioner the same way ever again."<b>--Karl Jacoby, Columbia University</b></p><p>"<i>Power Lines</i> shakes up a field that I thought was unshakable. In this marvelous book, Needham captures the nature of modern suburbia within the framework of something that is at once obvious and invisible: electricity. From the coal dug up and burned on Navajo land to feed a million Phoenix air conditioners to the Colorado River's tempting gigawatts, which served as the Cold War's hidden fuel, <i>Power Lines</i> tells the indispensable history of the metropolitan Southwest."<b>--Robert O. Self, Brown University</b></p><p>"<i>Power Lines</i> is a sweeping reassessment of how energy, political economy, and environmental transformation are at the core of regional development in the postwar United States. The story here is particular to Phoenix, but it has analogs elsewhere, from Los Angeles to New York City. A complex, ambitious, and dynamically rich book."<b>--Matthew Klingle, author of <i>Emerald City: An Environmental History of Seattle</i></b></p><b>Andrew Needham</b> is associate professor of history at New York University.</p><h2>Purpose and Desire: What Makes Something &#34;Alive&#34; and Why Modern Darwinism Has Failed to Explain It</h2><p><p>A professor, biologist, and physiologist argues that modern Darwinism&#x2019;s materialist and mechanistic biases have led to a scientific dead end, unable to define what life is&#x2014;and only an openness to the qualities of "purpose and desire" will move the field forward.</p><p>Scott Turner contends. "To be scientists, we force ourselves into a Hobson&#x2019;s choice on the matter: accept intentionality and purposefulness as real attributes of life, which disqualifies you as a scientist; or become a scientist and dismiss life&#x2019;s distinctive quality from your thinking. I have come to believe that this choice actually stands in the way of our having a fully coherent theory of life." </p><p>Growing research shows that&nbsp;life's most distinctive quality, shared by all living things, is&nbsp;purpose and desire: maintain homeostasis to sustain life. In <em>Purpose and Desire,</em> Turner draws on the work of Claude Bernard, a contemporary of Darwin revered among physiologists as the founder of experimental medicine, to build on Bernard&#x2019;s "dangerous idea" of vitalism, which seeks to identify what makes "life" a unique phenomenon of nature. To further its quest to achieve a fuller understanding of life, Turner argues, science must move beyond strictly accepted measures that consider only the mechanics of nature. </p><p>A thoughtful appeal to widen our perspective of biology that is grounded in scientific evidence, <em>Purpose and Desire</em> helps us bridge the ideological evolutionary divide.</p></p><p><p>Has Darwinism led us into a scientific dead end? </p><strong>DR.

During his lifetime Ferenczi, a respected associate and intimate of Freud, unleashed widely disputed ideas that influenced greatly the evolution of modern psychoanalytic technique and practice. In a sequence of short, condensed entries, S�ndor Ferenczi's Diary records self-critical reflections on conventional theory--as well as criticisms of Ferenczi's own experiments with technique--and his obstinate struggle to divest himself and psychoanalysis of professional hypocrisy. From these pages emerges a hitherto unheard voice, speaking to his heirs with startling candor and forceful originality--a voice that still resonates in the continuing debates over the nature of the relationship in psychoanalytic practice. </p></p><p><b>Judith Dupont </b>is a psychoanalyst and lives in Paris.Text: English, French, German (translation)</p><h2>Wisdom from a Shaker Garden</h2><p>Culled from the gardens and pantries of the Shakers, a gift collection of gardening tips, heirloom recipes, herbal remedies, inspiring poems, sayings, and songs features full-color photographs of restored Shaker vegetable and herb gardens, tools, and artwork. 17,500 first printing.</p><p></p><h2>The Future of Religion: Secularization, Revival and Cult Formation</h2><p>Religion is alive and well in the modern world, and the social-scientific study of religion is undergoing a renaissance.

Using information derived from numerous surveys, censuses, historical case studies, and ethnographic field expeditions, they chart the full sweep of contemporary religion from the traditional denominations to the most fervent cults. This wealth of information is located within a coherent theoretical framework that examines religion as a social response to human needs, both the general needs shared by all and the desires specific to those who are denied the economic rewards or prestige enjoyed by the privileged. By explaining the forms taken by religions today, Stark and Bainbridge allow us to understand its persistence in a secular age and its prospects for the future, <br><br></p><p></p><h2>London Fog: The Biography</h2><p><p>In popular imagination, London is a city of fog. The classic London fogs, the thick yellow &#x201c;pea-soupers,&#x201d; were born in the industrial age of the early nineteenth century. The first globally notorious instance of air pollution, they remained a constant feature of cold, windless winter days until clean air legislation in the 1960s brought about their demise. Christine L. Corton tells the story of these epic London fogs, their dangers and beauty, and their lasting effects on our culture and imagination.</p><p>As the city grew, smoke from millions of domestic fires, combined with industrial emissions and naturally occurring mists, seeped into homes, shops, and public buildings in dark yellow clouds of water droplets, soot, and sulphur dioxide. The fogs were sometimes so thick that people could not see their own feet. By the time London&#x2019;s fogs lifted in the second half of the twentieth century, they had changed urban life. Fogs had created worlds of anonymity that shaped social relations, providing a cover for crime, and blurring moral and social boundaries. They had been a gift to writers, appearing famously in the works of Charles Dickens, Henry James, Oscar Wilde, Robert Louis Stevenson, Joseph Conrad, and T. S. Eliot. Whistler and Monet painted London fogs with a fascination other artists reserved for the clear light of the Mediterranean.</p><p>Corton combines historical and literary sensitivity with an eye for visual drama&#x2015;generously illustrated here&#x2015;to reveal London fog as one of the great urban spectacles of the industrial age.</p></p><p>Christine L. Corton is a Senior Member of Wolfson College, Cambridge, and a freelance writer. She worked for many years at publishing houses in London.<b>Christine Corton</b> takes a subject that is now scarcely more than a heritage item&#x2015;like gaslight and hansom cabs&#x2015;and puts it where it belongs among the great public-health movements of the 19th and 20th centuries... Of course, fog was not solely a public-health problem. With the help of wonderful contemporary illustrations, Corton vividly describes the chaos it brought&#x2015;pedestrians groping, traffic crawling, accidents, crime and drunkenness soaring. The melting, blurring, looming transformations of fog seemed to symbolize the dissolution of society itself. Writers saw the possibilities, and Corton pursues their metaphorical fogs through every kind of moral, psychological and social disintegration. Charles Dickens, Henry James, Joseph Conrad, Robert Louis Stevenson, all are here&#x2015;plus a mass of fascinating and forgotten popular literature&#x2015;their cultural meanings perceptively analyzed... This is a rich and multifaceted book. (<i>The Economist</i>)<br><br>Brilliant...<b>Corton</b> has a deft historical, literary and visual eye. While tracing the birth, maturity and death of fog, she pays careful attention to the ways it affected everyday lives and locations...But her real interest is in the way fog played in the imagination. For centuries, she shows, novelists, essayists, cartoonists and painters used fog as a metaphor for human relationships and the moral order...Corton&#x2019;s book is an unsentimental and elegant reflection on a world that has passed. (Joanna Bourke <i>Daily Telegraph</i>)<br><br>Engrossing and magnificently researched...<b>Corton</b>&#x2019;s book combines meticulous social history with a wealth of eccentric detail. Thus we learn that London&#x2019;s ubiquitous plane trees were chosen for their shiny, fog-resistant foliage. And since Jack the Ripper actually went out to stalk his victims on fog-free nights, filmmakers had to fake the sort of dank, smoke-wreathed London scenes audiences craved. It&#x2019;s discoveries like these that make reading <i>London Fog</i> such an unusual, enthralling and enlightening experience. (Miranda Seymour <i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>Endlessly entertaining... <b>Corton</b> has done a prodigious amount of research into the phenomenon of the &#x2018;pea-soup&#x2019; fogs that enveloped London at regular intervals throughout the Industrial Age... Corton&#x2019;s book is merrily chock-full of illustrations... But the real star attraction in these pages is Corton&#x2019;s exuberant omniscience about her subject. She seems to have read every tenth-rate serialized novel in the whole of the Victorian and Edwardian literary shrubbery, hunting out every mention and dramatization of the great fogs and in the process giving some truly wretched writers what will surely be the most intelligent reading they&#x2019;re ever likely to get. And she&#x2019;s got an equally good ear for reportage, finding piercing quotes from every era of the fog&#x2019;s domination... <i>London Fog</i> has enjoyed a nicely wide critical reception since its appearance, and it deserves every accolade it gets. This is tight-focus popular history at its finest. (Steve Donoghue <i>Open Letters Monthly</i>)<br><br>The idea of a biography of fog in London might initially appear a doubtful enterprise, but in <b>Christine Corton</b>&#x2019;s capable hands it works brilliantly. The liveliness of metropolitan fog is beautifully charted here in a long chronology from the Stuart era to the Clean Air Acts of the 1950s to 1990s...[A] most extraordinarily rich collection of material from scientific, journalistic, literary, humorous, artistic and medical sources...She has created a history of fog&#x2019;s material and immaterial culture...The text is interspersed with some astonishing visual material, appropriately placed, making the book a visual feast especially of little-known artworks, caricatures and photographs of great beauty. Corton&#x2019;s use of the perceptions of foreign visitors, especially those from China and Japan, is revelatory...<i>London Fog</i> is not just a literary exercise; it also charts the long trajectory of a deeply serious public health matter that we have yet to confront, as we should, once again...This fine book has real substance, generously shared, and is very timely indeed. (Ruth Richardson <i>Times Higher Education</i>)<br><br>[<b>Corton</b>&#x2019;s] fascinating history traces London&#x2019;s unique brand of photochemical smog from its surprisingly early birth in the 13th century, when complaints about the burning of &#x2018;sea coal&#x2019; in London hearths began, through its malign maturity in the 19th, to its death throes in the second half of the 20th...The many well-chosen images in <i>London Fog</i> include works by minor painters of London scenes and by various illustrators, photojournalists and cartoonists playing on the terror, confusion and comedy caused by fog. These add greatly to the interest of Corton&#x2019;s book. (Catherine Peters <i>Literary Review</i>)<br><br><b>Christine Corton</b>&#x2019;s excellent book explores three questions: how people accounted for London fog, what they did about it, and how it became such an enormous, apparently inexhaustible cultural resource and metaphor...Corton has assembled an astonishing display of fog fiction...Corton has written a thoughtful, vivid, very memorable book.

Yet I smell the blooming evening primrose and hear the throaty chirps and creaky rattles of the purple martins flitting home across the marsh. I see their sleek iridescent bodies gliding against the bloodred sunset sky, through the blackened Corinthian columns and crumbling chimneys of Carrowmore. The house is named after a legendary thin place, far away in Ireland. I can hear Ceecee&#x2019;s voice again in my head, telling me what the name means, and why I should stay away. But as with most things Ceecee has ever told me, I didn&#x2019;t listen.</p><p>Carrowmore and I are both in ruins now, with wrinkles in our plaster and faults in our foundations. It&#x2019;s oddly fitting that I should die in this house. I almost died here once before, when I was a little girl. I wonder if the house has been waiting for its second chance.</p><p>The thrum of Ellis&#x2019;s 1966 Mustang rumbles in the distance. If I could move, I&#x2019;d run out the front door and down the walk before he can honk the horn and irritate Daddy. There&#x2019;s nothing Daddy dislikes more than Ellis&#x2019;s long hair and that car.</p><p>But I can&#x2019;t move. All I remember is stepping on a soft spot in the old wooden floor, then hearing the splintering of ancient, rotten wood. Now I&#x2019;m lying here, broken in so many pieces.</p><p>My brain reminds me that Ellis has been gone forty years. His precious car sold before he shipped out to Fort Gordon in 1969. Still, the acrid scent of exhaust wafts over me, and I wonder with an odd hopefulness whether it&#x2019;s Ellis, coming for me after all this time.</p><p>There&#x2019;s something soft and silky crumpled in my fist. My fingers must have held tight when I first felt the ancient floor give way beneath my feet.</p><p>A hair ribbon. I&#x2019;d pulled it from Larkin&#x2019;s dresser drawer. My sweet baby girl. The daughter who&#x2019;d always desperately wanted to be just like me. Almost as desperately as I wanted her to be different. I wanted her to be happy. Not that Larkin is a girl anymore. She&#x2019;s too old for ribbons, but I kept everything in her room just the same as she left it, hoping one day she&#x2019;d come home for good. Decide it was time to forgive all of us. To forgive herself.</p><p>I remember now using a black marker to write down the length of the ribbon, the letters bold and big, shouting my anger with silent strokes. But that&#x2019;s the only clear memory I have. I can&#x2019;t feel that anger anymore. Nor remember the reason for it. I must have driven here, but I don&#x2019;t remember. Just me writing on that ribbon, and then here, falling. My brain is playing tricks on me, recalling things from long ago with the clarity of hindsight, yet leaving what happened only thirty minutes ago in a dark closet behind a locked door.</p><p>Bright pops of air explode inside my skull. Streaks of light like shooting stars flit past my line of vision. I think they&#x2019;re the purple martins of my past, constant as the moon and stars in my memories. And then the pain comes, white-hot and precise, settling at the base of my head, then traveling upward, a large hand slowly constricting my brain.</p><p>Then darkness covers me like a mask, and everything fades away. Except for the engine fumes of an old car, and the raucous chirp of a thousand martins coming home to roost.</p><p></p><br><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>Larkin</p><p>2010</p><p>The introductory notes to an old song distracted me for a moment, causing me to glance up from my computer and look around with an oddly satisfying appreciation. I loved my desk. Not because it was beautiful or rare&#x2014;it was neither&#x2014;but because of its simple functionality.</p><p>It was no different from the metal desks of the other copywriters at Wax &amp; Crandall, the ad agency where I&#x2019;d worked for the past five years, except mine was devoid of all personal effects. No frames, no kitschy knickknacks or rubber-band balls. Nothing tacked up on the walls of my cubicle, either, or mementos of my four years spent at Fordham earning my undergraduate degree. My one concession to my past was a gold chain with three charms on it that I never removed but kept tucked inside my neckline.</p><p>I loved that nobody asked me why I seemed to have no past. This was New York, after all, where people seemed to care only about where you were going, not where you&#x2019;d been. They just assumed that I had no husband or significant other, no children or siblings. Which was correct. The people I worked with knew I was from somewhere down south only because every once in a while, a long consonant or dropped syllable found its way into my sentences. I never mentioned that I was born and raised in Georgetown, South Carolina, or that if I closed my eyes long enough, I could still smell the salt marshes and the rivers that surrounded my hometown. My coworkers probably believed that I hated my home and that was why I left. And in that assumption, they&#x2019;d be wrong.</p><p>There are reasons other than hating a place that make a person leave.</p><p>&#x201c;Knock, knock.&#x201d;</p><p>I turned to see Josephine&#x2014;not &#x201c;Jo&#x201d; or &#x201c;Josie,&#x201d; but &#x201c;Josephine&#x201d;&#x2014;standing at the entrance to my cubicle. The lack of a door meant people had to improvise when they wanted to enter. She was one of our account executives, a nice enough person if she liked you but someone to avoid if she didn&#x2019;t.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you busy?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>My fingers were at that moment poised above my keyboard, which made her question unnecessary, but Josephine wasn&#x2019;t the type to notice such things. She was one of those women who commanded attention because of the way she looked&#x2014;petite, with sun-streaked brown hair, and perpetually tanned&#x2014;so it had become customary for her to get what she wanted with just a smile.</p><p>I was streaming Pandora on my computer, and the song playing would distract me until I could name it. It was an old habit I&#x2019;d never been able to break. &#x201c;Dream On.&#x201d; Aerosmith. I smiled to myself.</p><p>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d; Josephine said, and I realized I&#x2019;d spoken aloud.</p><p>I thought back to her question. &#x201c;Actually&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;,&#x201d; I said, but as I began, the vague feeling of disquiet that had been hovering over me since I&#x2019;d awakened exploded into foreboding.</p><p>Ceecee would have said it was just somebody walking over my grave, but I knew it was the dream I&#x2019;d remembered from the night before. A dream of falling, my arms and legs flailing, waiting to hit an invisible bottom.</p><p>Ignoring my body language, Josephine stepped closer. &#x201c;Because I wanted to ask you about a dream I had last night. I was running, but it felt as if my feet were stuck in glue.&#x201d;</p><p>I let my wrists rest on the edge of my desk but didn&#x2019;t swivel my chair, hoping she&#x2019;d take the hint. &#x201c;You can Google it, you know. You can find out a lot about dreams on the Internet. It&#x2019;s handy that way.&#x201d; I kept my hands poised near the keyboard.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I know, but I just thought it would be quicker if I asked you. Since you&#x2019;re the expert.&#x201d; She beamed a smile at me.</p><p>With a sigh, I turned around to face her. I wasn&#x2019;t an expert&#x2014;only well-read on the subject after years spent trying to analyze my mother&#x2019;s dreams in an attempt to understand her better. As my delusional childhood self, I&#x2019;d thought knowing what was in my mother&#x2019;s head would help me unlock the reasons for the sadness and restlessness behind her eyes. I&#x2019;d hoped she would be so grateful, she&#x2019;d include me in her various quests for peace and beauty. I&#x2019;d failed, but in the process, I&#x2019;d discovered an avid interest in these windows into our subconscious. It gave me something to talk about at the rare parties I attended, a parlor trick I could pull out when conversation faltered.</p><p>&#x201c;There are probably a million interpretations, but I think it might mean that some ambition in your life, like your career or love life, isn&#x2019;t progressing as you&#x2019;d like it to be, and you feel as if something were holding you back.&#x201d;</p><p>Josephine blinked at me for several seconds, and I wasn&#x2019;t sure whether she either didn&#x2019;t understand or was in complete denial that anything could ever hold her back. &#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; Josephine said, smiling brightly again, any self-doubt quickly erased. &#x201c;You going with the group from sales to the Hamptons for the weekend?&#x201d;</p><p>I shook my head, eager to get back to work. I was at the gym every afternoon at five thirty, meaning I had to leave at five. Though it kept me in shape, the habit didn&#x2019;t allow for much after-hours socializing. Not that I didn&#x2019;t like my coworkers&#x2014;I did. They were a fun, creative, and young group, including a smattering of millennials who didn&#x2019;t act too much like millennials. I just found that I preferred socializing with them in an office setting, making it easier to escape back to my desk if any question went beyond which apartment I lived in and whether I preferred the subway or cabbing it.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I think I&#x2019;ll stay in the city.&#x201d; It never ceased to amaze me that people who complained about the crowded city always seemed to gravitate toward the same beaches at the same time with the same people from whom they were trying to escape. &#x201c;The water will be ice-cold, anyway. It&#x2019;s still only April.&#x201d;</p><p>Josephine scrunched up her nose, and I noticed how nothing else wrinkled. She said she used Botox only as a preventative measure, but from what I could tell, she was well on her way to looking like one of the gargoyle women I saw shopping in the high-end stores on Fifth Avenue. As Ceecee would say, it just wasn&#x2019;t natural.</p><p>&#x201c;Not any colder than usual,&#x201d; Josephine insisted. &#x201c;Come on. It&#x2019;ll be fun. We&#x2019;ve got a huge house in Montauk. There&#x2019;re two queen beds in my room, if you don&#x2019;t mind sharing with me. You could analyze everyone&#x2019;s dreams.&#x201d;</p><p>I was tempted. I&#x2019;d never been part of a group or hung out with girls who rented houses together and took trips on the weekends. For a brief time in elementary school, I&#x2019;d had a cluster of friends my age, but by the time we reached middle school, they&#x2019;d formed their own smaller groups, none of which included me. I&#x2019;d always had Mabry and her twin brother, Bennett, though. Our mothers were best friends, and we&#x2019;d been bathed in the same bathtub when we were babies. That right there made us best friends, whether or not we ever acknowledged it. At least until our senior year in high school, when we&#x2019;d stopped being friends at all.</p><p>The memory made it easier for me to shake my head. &#x201c;Thanks for the invite, but I&#x2019;ll stay home. I might rearrange my furniture. I&#x2019;ve been thinking about it.&#x201d;</p><p>Josephine gave me an odd look. &#x201c;Sure. Oh, well, maybe it&#x2019;s for the best. I don&#x2019;t want to be the one standing next to you wearing a bikini&#x2014;that&#x2019;s for sure.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;For the record, I don&#x2019;t own a bikini.&#x201d; I was more a T-shirt-and-boy-shorts type girl. &#x201c;But thanks for asking. Maybe next time, okay?&#x201d;</p><p>My cell phone buzzed where it lay faceup on my desk. I didn&#x2019;t have a picture or a name stored in the directory, but I didn&#x2019;t need to. It was the first cell phone number I&#x2019;d ever memorized. When I didn&#x2019;t move to pick it up, Josephine pointed to it with her chin. &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you going to get that?&#x201d;</p><p>It was oddly telling that she didn&#x2019;t excuse herself to give me privacy. I reached over and silenced it. &#x201c;No. I&#x2019;ll call him back later.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Him?&#x201d; she asked suggestively.</p><p>&#x201c;My father.&#x201d; I never took his calls, no matter how many times he tried. When I&#x2019;d first come to New York, the calls were more frequent, but over the past year or so, they&#x2019;d tapered down to about one per week&#x2014;sprinkled across different days and times, as if he were trying to catch me off guard. He wasn&#x2019;t giving up. And neither was I. I&#x2019;d inherited the Lanier bullheadedness from him, after all.</p><p>&#x201c;So, you have a father.&#x201d; Josephine looked at me expectantly.</p><p>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t everyone?&#x201d;</p><p>The phone started buzzing again. I was about to toss it in my drawer, when I noticed it was a different number, another number that I knew and received calls from frequently, but never when I was at work. It was Ceecee, the woman who&#x2019;d raised my mother, who was pretty much my grandmother in standing. She was too in awe of my working in New York City to ever want to interrupt me during office hours. Unless there was a good reason.</p><p>I picked up the phone. &#x201c;Please excuse me,&#x201d; I said to Josephine. &#x201c;I need to take this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; Josephine said. &#x201c;Just know that if your body is ever found behind some Dumpster in Queens, we won&#x2019;t know who to call.&#x201d;</p><p>Ignoring her, I turned my back to the cubicle opening. &#x201c;Ceecee?&#x201d; I spoke into the phone. &#x201c;Is everything all right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, sweetheart. I&#x2019;m afraid it&#x2019;s not.&#x201d; Her voice sounded thick, as if she had a cold. Or had been crying. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s your mama.&#x201d;</p><p>I sat up straighter. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with Mama?&#x201d; I tried to prepare myself for her answer. Ivy Lanier was anything but predictable. But anything I could have imagined couldn&#x2019;t have prepared me for what Ceecee said next.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s missing. Nobody&#x2019;s seen her since yesterday morning. Your daddy said when he got home from work yesterday that she and her car were gone. We&#x2019;ve called all of her friends, but nobody&#x2019;s seen her or heard from her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yesterday morning? Have you called the police?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes&#x2014;the minute I heard. The sheriff has filed a report, and he&#x2019;s got people looking for her.&#x201d;</p><p>My mind filled and emptied like the marsh at the turning of the tides, enough stray bits clinging that I could form my first question. &#x201c;Where was she yesterday morning?&#x201d;</p><p>A pause. &#x201c;She was here. She&#x2019;s been here just about every day for the last month, refinishing her daddy&#x2019;s old desk out in the garage. She&#x2019;d come inside&#x2014;I only know that because she left the kitchen a mess, the drawers yanked out. Like she was looking for something.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you have no idea what?&#x201d; The thread of panic that had woven into my voice surprised me.</p><p>There was a longer pause this time, as if Ceecee were considering the question. And the possible answer. &#x201c;I thought she might have wanted more spare rags for the refinishing. I keep a bag on the floor of the pantry. It&#x2019;s empty, though. She must have forgotten she&#x2019;d used them all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But she was looking through the drawers and cabinets.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. When I saw her car pull away, I thought she was just running to the hardware store. But the police have checked&#x2014;she didn&#x2019;t go there. Your daddy and I are beside ourselves with worry.&#x201d;</p><p>I closed my eyes, anticipating her next words.</p><p>&#x201c;Please come home, Larkin. I need someone here. I&#x2019;m afraid&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Her voice caught, and she was silent.</p><p>&#x201c;Ceecee, you know Mama is always off in one direction or another. You&#x2019;ve always called her a dandelion seed&#x2014;remember? This wouldn&#x2019;t be the first time she&#x2019;s run off without explanation.&#x201d; The words sounded hollow, even to me. My dream returned to me suddenly, jerking me backward as if I&#x2019;d finally hit the ground, the air knocked from my lungs.</p><p>&#x201c;She always comes back the same day,&#x201d; Ceecee said fiercely. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve checked all the roads within a hundred miles of here. Your daddy&#x2019;s driven Highway Seventeen all the way up to Myrtle Beach, as far south as Charleston.&#x201d; She paused again. &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t going to tell you this, but I had a dream last night. I dreamed I was falling.&#x201d;</p><p>I stared at the black letters against the white background on my computer screen, lines and symbols that suddenly meant nothing at all. &#x201c;Did you...</p></p><h2>Cup of Gold: A Life of Sir Henry Morgan, Buccaneer, with Occasional Reference to History (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)</h2><p>This lush, lyrical fantasy is Steinbeck&#39;s sole work of historical fiction. Henry Morgan ruled the Spanish Main in the 1670s, ravaging the coasts of Cuba and America and striking terror wherever he went. His lust and greed knew no bounds, and he was utterly consumed by two passions; to possess the mysterious woman known as La Santa Roja, the Red Saint, and to conquer Panama and wrest &#39;the cup of gold&#39; from Spanish hands. This work is a fantastic, swashbuckling stuff!</p><p>7 1-hour cassettes<p><b>John Steinbeck</b>, born in Salinas, California, in 1902, grew up in a fertile agricultural valley, about twenty-five miles from the Pacific Coast. Both the valley and the coast would serve as settings for some of his best fiction. In 1919 he went to Stanford University, where he intermittently enrolled in literature and writing courses until he left in 1925 without taking a degree. During the next five years he supported himself as a laborer and journalist in New York City, all the time working on his first novel,&nbsp;<i>Cup of Gold</i>&nbsp;(1929).<br> &nbsp;<br> After marriage and a move to Pacific Grove, he published two California books,&nbsp;<i>The Pastures of Heaven</i>&nbsp;(1932) and&nbsp;<i>To a God Unknown</i>&nbsp;(1933), and worked on short stories later collected in&nbsp;<i>The Long Valley</i>&nbsp;(1938). Popular success and financial security came only with&nbsp;<i>Tortilla Flat</i><b>&nbsp;</b>(1935), stories about Monterey&#x2019;s paisanos. A ceaseless experimenter throughout his career, Steinbeck changed courses regularly. Three powerful novels of the late 1930s focused on the California laboring class:&nbsp;<i>In Dubious Battle</i>&nbsp;(1936),&nbsp;<i>Of Mice and Men</i>&nbsp;(1937), and the book considered by many his finest,&nbsp;<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;(1939).&nbsp;<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;won both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize in 1939.<br> &nbsp;<br> Early in the 1940s, Steinbeck became a filmmaker with&nbsp;<i>The Forgotten Village</i>&nbsp;(1941) and a serious student of marine biology with&nbsp;<i>Sea of Cortez</i>&nbsp;(1941). He devoted his services to the war, writing Bombs Away (1942) and the controversial play-novelette&nbsp;<i>The Moon is Down</i>&nbsp;(1942).<i>Cannery Row</i>&nbsp;(1945),&nbsp;<i>The Wayward Bus</i>&nbsp;(1948), another experimental drama,&nbsp;<i>Burning Bright</i>(1950), and&nbsp;<i>The Log from the Sea of Cortez</i>&nbsp;(1951) preceded publication of the monumental&nbsp;<i>East of Eden</i>&nbsp;(1952), an ambitious saga of the Salinas Valley and his own family&#x2019;s history.<br> &nbsp;<br> The last decades of his life were spent in New York City and Sag Harbor with his third wife, with whom he traveled widely. Later books include&nbsp;<i>Sweet Thursday</i>&nbsp;(1954),&nbsp;<i>The Short Reign of Pippin IV: A Fabrication</i>&nbsp;(1957),&nbsp;<i>Once There Was a War</i><b>&nbsp;</b>(1958),&nbsp;<i>The Winter of Our Discontent&nbsp;</i>(1961),<i>Travels with Charley in Search of America</i><b>&nbsp;</b>(1962),&nbsp;<i>America and Americans</i>&nbsp;(1966), and the posthumously published&nbsp;<i>Journal of a Novel: The East of Eden Letters</i>&nbsp;(1969),&nbsp;<i>Viva Zapata!</i>(1975),&nbsp;<i>The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights</i>&nbsp;(1976), and&nbsp;<i>Working Days: The Journals of The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;(1989).<br> &nbsp;<br> Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1962, and, in 1964, he was presented with the United States Medal of Freedom by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Steinbeck died in New York in 1968. Today, more than thirty years after his death, he remains one of America's greatest writers and cultural figures.&nbsp;<br></p></p><h2>Camping Out (American Roots)</h2><p>In this piece from 1920&#x2015;originally published as a newspaper article in the Toronto Daily Star&#x2015;a young Ernest Hemingway provides solid advice to the novice camper.

Sometimes we would camp out: cool star-filled evenings sitting by the fire and spectacular sunrises after not-very-restful nights.

The book guides artists through the process of drawing the human figure as it pertains to anatomy, proportions, volume, mass, gesture, movement, and expression. From there, the book reveals how these characteristics come together using light, shape, line, and form to accurately depict the human figure in a variety of everyday poses, including standing, sitting, reclining, and action. Each section features color photographs of people in several "core" poses (e.g., sitting, reclining, and action), as well as multiple variations of those poses. Step-by-step artist illustrations demonstrate how to render the core pose, whereas illustrations and professional tips demonstrate how to turn the core pose into a new variation. In addition, step-by-step drawing instructions and techniques demonstrate how to capture realistic poses as they differ from one person to the next across a range of human characteristics, such as age (child, teen, adult, senior citizen); body type (ectomorph, mesomorph, endomorph); gender; and activity (e.g., athlete, dancer, etc.).

Born in Edinburgh in Scotland, he began writing short stories while studying medicine. His first work featuring Sherlock Holmes, A Study in Scarlet, was published in 1886. Relentlessly curious about a vast range of subjects, his interests were reflected in the vast array of knowledge that Sherlock Holmes exhibited in his stories. Conan Doyle died at the age of 71 and is buried in Hampshire.</p><h2>Apocalypse: A People's Commentary on the Book of Revelation (Bible &amp; Liberation Series)</h2><p>The Book of Revelation has always been a mysterious and intriguing book, describing in symbolic terms the confrontation between the disciples of Christ and the powers - political and supernatural - that hold sway over the current age. Fundamentalists have been attracted to the book and have sought to decipher its strange symbols as coded prophecy of future events. But as Pablo Richard shows in Apocalypse, the most powerful readings of the Book of Revelation are through the eyes of the oppressed, living out their Christian faith in the context of the modern empire. It is they who identify most strongly with Revelation's ultimate message of hope and life in the midst of death and persecution.<br>Apocalypse first provides a general introduction to the reading of Revelation by examining three keys for its understanding: the historical, the sociological, and the literary-structural. The book then goes on to explore the whole of the Book of Revelation, following the book's own structure. Each section provides a line-by-line reading of the text, establishing the literal meaning before applying the interpretive keys already established.</p><p>Phillip Berryman is a writer, translator, and teacher who worked in Panama and Central America for a dozen years in the 1960s and 1970s.

Emphasizing the collaborative nature of the therapist-client relationship and using a practical, three-stage model that drives client problem-managing and opportunity-developing action, Egan leads readers step by step through the counseling process, while giving them a feeling for the complexity inherent in any helping relationship. As readers master the various steps of the helping model, they are able to improve their competence and confidence measurably.</p><p>Gerard Egan, Ph.D., is Emeritus Professor of Psychology and Organizational Studies at Loyola University of Chicago. He has written over a dozen books and currently writes in the areas of communication, counseling, business and organization effectiveness, management development, leadership, the management of innovation and change, and organization politics and culture. He also conducts workshops in these areas both in the United States and abroad and is a consultant at a variety of companies and institutions worldwide."This book contains a cogent and lively presentation of a "generic" problem-solving approach to counseling. It is concretized by many excellent, easily understood examples, which are not only culturally diverse but also up-to-date in terms of world events. The concepts are offered in a logical (yet flexible) manner so that the counseling process can be understood by the students and the counseling skills can be experienced both in the classroom and in the students' personal lives."<br><br>". . . Dr. Egan's inclusion of the "darker side" of counseling is an important contribution to a text for beginning therapists. These topics bring a balance and reality to the sometimes overly altruistic aims of those becoming helpers. Dr. Egan explains and illustrates all of the skills that a helper, regardless of training discipline (psychotherapist, minister, nurse), needs to become an effective counselor. This book attacks the topics that can make the helper successful or unsuccessful."<br><br>"I think that Egan has presented his overview of the model and the skills involved in the counseling process very clearly and convincingly, and his examples illustrate the concepts in a way that deepens our understanding. The sequencing is somewhat different [in this edition], yet flows even more logically, both between chapters and within each one."</p><h2>How to Read the Bible: History, Prophecy, Literature--Why Modern Readers Need to Know the Difference and What It Means for Faith Today</h2><p>McKenzie argues that to comprehend the Bible we must grasp the intentions of the biblical authors themselves--what sort of texts they thought they were writing and how they would have been understood by their intended audience. In short, we must recognize the genres to which these texts belong. McKenzie examines several genres that are typically misunderstood, offering careful readings of specific texts to show how the confusion arises, and how knowing the genre produces a correct reading. The book of Jonah, for example, offers many clues that it is meant as a humorous satire, not a straight-faced historical account of a man who was swallowed by a fish. Likewise, McKenzie explains that the very names "Adam" and "Eve" tell us that these are not historical characters, but figures who symbolize human origins ("Adam" means man , "Eve" is related to the word for life ). Similarly, the authors of apocalyptic texts--including the Book of Revelation--were writing allegories of events that were happening in their own time. Not for a moment could they imagine that centuries afterwards, readers would be poring over their works for clues to the date of the Second Coming of Christ, or when and how the world would end.<br><br>For anyone who takes reading the Bible seriously and who wants to get it right, this book will be both heartening and enlightening.<br></p><p><br>Steven McKenzie is Professor of Hebrew Bible at Rhodes College, in Memphis, Tennessee.

McKenzie offers a fresh take on the ancient texts of the Bible and allows us to see the familiar biblical landscape in wholly new and illuminating ways. How to Read the Bible is authoritative and provocative, often witty and always insightful and illuminating, an essential tool for modern readers of the Jewish and Christian scriptures." <br>--Jonathan Kirsch, author of <em>God Against the Gods: The History of the War Between Monotheism and Polytheism</em> and <em>The Harlot by the Side of the Road: Forbidden Tales of the Bible</em><p></p><br>"In order to determine what the Bible means, we must first determine the intentions of its authors, intentions expressed in the literary genres they used. In his examination of several genres used in the Bible, McKenzie demonstrates through detailed analysis how the identification of genre is as necessary for the understanding of biblical literature as it is of any literature. An important and insightful book." <br>--Michael D.

When he won, she . . . went on a national tour to crusade on behalf of women. She wrote a regular newspaper column. She became a champion of women's rights and of civil rights. And she decided to write a book."--Jill Lepore, from the Introduction<br>"Women, whether subtly or vociferously, have always been a tremendous power in the destiny of the world," Eleanor Roosevelt wrote in <i>It's Up to the Women</i>, her book of advice to women of all ages on every aspect of life. Written at the height of the Great Depression, she called on women particularly to do their part--cutting costs where needed, spending reasonably, and taking personal responsibility for keeping the economy going.<br>Whether it's the recommendation that working women take time for themselves in order to fully enjoy time spent with their families, recipes for cheap but wholesome home-cooked meals, or America's obligation to women as they take a leading role in the new social order, many of the opinions expressed here are as fresh as if they were written today.</p><p><b>Eleanor Roosevelt</b> (1884-1962) was an American politician, diplomat, and activist.

Ably reintroduced by the brilliant Jill Lepore, this book is as timely now as when it first appeared in the depths of the Depression.. . .

As an adult, she played the guitar and the harpsichord, danced regularly, and took a connoisseur's interest in all the arts. <br><br>In this comprehensive interdisciplinary biography, James Winn tells the story of Anne's life in new breadth and detail, and in unprecedented cultural context. Winn shows how poets, painters, and musicians used the works they made for Anne to send overt and covert political messages to the queen, the court, the church, and Parliament. Their works also illustrate the pathos of Anne's personal life: the loss of her mother when she was six, her troubled relations with her father and her sister (James II and Mary II), and her own doomed efforts to produce an heir. Her eighteen pregnancies produced only one child who lived past infancy; his death at the age of eleven, mourned by poets, was a blow from which Anne never fully recovered. Her close friendship with Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, a topic of scabrous ballads and fictions, ended in bitter discord; the death of her husband in 1708 left her emotionally isolated; and the wrangling among her chief ministers hastened her death.<br><br>Richly illustrated with visual and musical examples, <em>Queen Anne</em> draws on works by a wide array of artists-among them the composer George Frideric Handel, the poet Alexander Pope, the painter Godfrey Kneller, and the architect Christopher Wren-to shed new light on Anne's life and reign.

I doubt there is another critic so adept at reading the poetry, music, and painting of the period....Not least because it recognizes the importance of the arts for understanding the tensions and conflicts that Anne was forced to negotiate, <em>Queen Anne: Patroness of Arts</em> is a magnificent contribution to our understanding of her life and times."--<em>Restoration and Eighteenth-Century Theatre Research</em><p></p><br>[Winn] has produced a book of unparalleled depth and insight...[H]is historical research on all aspects of the period, including its political turmoil, is impeccable, and yet his writing has essayistic clarity throughout."--<em>The Times Literary Supplement</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The New York Times: A Nation Challenged A Visual History Of 9/11</h2><p>From the pages of The New York Times, A Nation Challenged: A Young Reader's Edition is a moving record of events and reactions from the attacks on 9/11 through the closing of the WTC recovery site.<br><br>In an intimate and moving portrait of the occurrences of September 11, 2001 and its aftermath, A Nation Challenged is a tragic, yet ultimately reassuring record of the most pivotal event in modern American history. After witnessing such monumental acts of destruction and violence, America's children were inundated with new fears.

This book will answer their questions about how and why these acts occurred in</p><p>Grade 4-9-Howell Raines, Executive Editor of the New York Times, introduces this book whose contents were culled from the Pulitzer prize-winning section of the paper, A Nation Challenged. The challenge, of course, was how to share a record of terrifying events and images in a responsible, age-appropriate manner. The editors have succeeded admirably. Through the generous use of white space; the carefully selected, climactic spreads contrasting with smaller, more personal scenes; and a clean design, including boxed tidbits of information, they give viewers a chance to breathe. Coverage of the three crash sites and the ensuing war is interspersed with snapshots of strong leaders, caring citizens, a global community united in grief, letters and art from peers, and scenes of Afghan children. Sometimes there is just one sentence per page, but the well-chosen words are packed with meaning and substance. The organization and content anticipate children's questions, e.g., detailed diagrams explain the physics of the towers' collapse or depict the interior of an Al Qaeda mountain bunker. The presentation, pacing, and progression are all orchestrated to make this resource informative and palatable for youngsters, without diminishing the overall impact. In moving from the May 30th photo of the ceremony accompanying the removal of the World Trade Center's last steel girder to the section on how children can help and the list of Web sites, this title signals a type of closure and a call to continue to think and to act.<br><i>Wendy Lukehart, Washington DC Public Library</i><br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.Gr. 6-12. Compiled by editors at the <i>New York Times</i>, this combines photographs and text excerpts from the paper's section, "A Nation Challenged," which was devoted to the shock waves following the 9/11 tragedy. An introduction from the paper's executive editor leads into four chapters that follow the day's events; the immediate aftermath of grieving, loss, and international support; the Afghan conflict; and finally, how life has changed at home--including rebuilding and tightened security. Each spread shows a different side of the events and their effects, and the accompanying brief text, lifted straight from articles, may often be too sophisticated for younger children. Diagrams of the Twin Towers and an al-Qaeda bunker are interesting but may also lose some readers. It's the Pulitzer Prize-winning photographs that make this book so valuable. The editors have left out the harshest scenes of human suffering without shying away from the devastating story: the planes' impact, the imploding buildings, heroic escape and rescue efforts; the smoking rubble and multidenominational shrines; the army of relief workers; U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan. Young people (and adults) struggling to understand the enormity of 9/11 events will want to start here, with the highest-quality images--"the record of our changed world"--that will encourage readers to confront their feelings. Short suggestions in the final chapter offer ways to begin healing. <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Sing or shout or testify or keep it to yourself: but know whence you came.&#39; Originally published in 1953, Go Tell it on the Mountain was James Baldwin&#39;s first major work, based in part on his own childhood in Harlem. With lyrical precision, psychological directness, resonating symbolic power and a rage that is at once unrelenting and compassionate, Baldwin chronicles a fourteen-year-old boy&#39;s discovery of the terms of his identity as the stepson of the minister of a Pentecostal storefront church in Harlem. Baldwin&#39;s rendering of his protagonist&#39;s spiritual, sexual and moral struggle towards self-invention opened new possibilities in the American language and in the way Americans understood themselves.</p><p><p><b>James Baldwin</b> (1924-1987) was educated in New York. His first novel, <i>Go Tell It on the Mountain</i>, received excellent reviews and was immediately recognized as establishing a profound and permanent new voice in American letters. The appearance of <i>The Fire Next Time</i> in 1963, just as the civil rights movement was exploding across the American South, galvanized the nation and continues to reverberate as perhaps the most prophetic and defining statement ever written of the continuing costs of Americans' refusal to face their own history. It became a national bestseller, and Baldwin was featured on the cover of <i>Time</i>. The next year, he was made a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters and collaborated with the photographer Richard Avedon on <i>Nothing Personal</i>, a series of portraits of America intended as a eulogy for the slain Medger Evers. His other collaborations include <i>A Rap on Race</i> with Margaret Mead and <i>A Dialogue</i> with the poet-activist Nikki Giovanni. He also adapted Alex Haley's <i>The Autobiography of Malcolm X</i> into <i>One Day When I Was Lost</i>. He was made a commander of the French Legion of Honor a year before his death, one honor among many he achieved in his life.</p>&#34;Something in his prose hit me, almost winding me with its intensity.

As a young woman, Madeleine got her training by working in a family restaurant in Touraine and in the kitchens of France&#39;�?s most respected regional cooks, who nourished her appetite for the tradition, rigor, and personal nature of cooking. Her exuberant and colorful memoir of that time-originally published over 25 years ago-tells of collecting mussels at the shore, churning butter from the milk of village cows, gathering mushrooms in nearby woods, and then transforming them into glorious food under the tutelage of her informal mentors. Over 250 recipes for the simple dishes she learned at their sides illustrate her evocative reminiscences of a bygone era in rural France. Part travelogue, part social history, part instruction manual, this classic is required reading for anyone who wants to know more about the life, times, and tastes of a woman who has helped shape American cooking.</p><p>MADELEINE KAMMAN was born in Paris and started her culinary career in 1940 at her aunt&#x2019;s restaurant in the Touraine region of France.

What many of them found there was no meritocracy, but an industry living by the rules of a 1960s fraternity, with the money and legal clout to silence any challenges. Award-winning columnist Susan Antilla broke the story of shocking sex discrimination at Smith Barney and other major brokers. Her disclosures in the press were a rallying cry for class actions challenging the sexual hazing and outrageous disparities in pay that shackled professional women on Wall Street.<br> <br> Taking its title from the infamous basement party room of Smith Barney&#x2019;s Garden City, New York, branch office, and representing years of extensive research,&nbsp;<i>Tales from the Boom-Boom Room</i> traces the story of the lead whistle-blower, Pam Martens, the crusading broker who put an entire industry on the defensive, then found herself at odds not just with her local bosses and with powerful figures like Travelers Group president Jamie Dimon, but with her coplaintiffs and attorneys. The women&#x2019;s employment agreements forbade them to sue, and only an ingenious legal strategy circumvented that virtual gag rule and brought the scandal out from behind the closed doors of arbitration. This is a riveting human, legal, and business drama of women and men in the financial institutions on Wall Street and around America.</p><p><b>Susan Antilla</b> has been investigating allegations of sexual harassment on Wall Street for the past seven years and broke several of its first major stories. Currently a columnist with Bloomberg News, she launched the weekly investing column in the Saturday edition and the &#x201c;Between Main &amp; Wall&#x201d; ombudsman column at <i>The New York Times.</i> She was bureau chief of the Money section of <i>USA Today</i> and financial bureau chief for <i>The Baltimore Sun.</i> Antilla was twice selected as a finalist for a Gerald Loeb Award for Distinguished Business and Financial Journalism.Prologue <p>At twenty-three, smart, attractive, with sweeping long dark hair, Lori Hurwitz started with tall ambitions as a rookie at the Garden City, New York, office of Shearson Lehman Brothers, one of the biggest firms on Wall Street. </p><p>Her job was to telephone total strangers and persuade them to open accounts and buy securities&#x2014;known as "cold-calling." She would initially make the pitches on behalf of two brokers in their early thirties who were senior to her. But she hoped to become a broker herself so that one day she could be a partner with her father, who worked at a different Shearson office. He was tickled that his daughter looked to him as a role model. Lori used to get up before sunrise during her summers off from school so that she could ride the train to New York City in the pitch black and spend the day with her dad at his big-time job. Now her childhood dreams of doing what he did were actually coming true. </p><p>They could work together in an exciting financial company that had it all: one that provided investment banking services for corporate customers who needed to raise money and retail brokerage services for individuals who had money to invest. But he warned her that his business was a rough place for women. </p><p>She should have paid more attention to that. Despite the trappings of Garden City, a pretty New York City suburb where mansions stood down the street from attractive middle-class houses with manicured lawns, the atmosphere inside the Shearson office was not what she had bargained for. </p><p>Her coworkers referred to women as "cunts" or "whores," or sometimes "bitches" or "tramps," depending on the label du jour. She sat in a small room with the two senior salesmen and two trainees, all male, all the time. There was no way to tune out their conversations. </p><p>The mentor assigned to her had opinions on the uselessness of females as sex partners after they&#x2019;d borne children. "As soon as a woman squeezes out a kid, you stamp &#x2018;A million dollars&#x2019; on the kid&#x2019;s forehead and &#x2018;Stretched goods&#x2019; on the woman&#x2019;s," he said. In between their calls to clients, the men talked technique&#x2014;not for selling stocks but for going down on their girlfriends, the sexual tricks and treats their bedmates gave them, the length of time they could keep up their erections. They called their paramours liberally on their work phones. Lori tried to concentrate on her cold calls, which totaled between 300 and 400 a day, and to pretend that none of it bothered her. </p><p>"You guys are pigs," she tossed off sometimes during the early months, giving it a dismissive tone that she hoped would come off as tough and detached. Maybe if they don&#x2019;t get a rise out of me, she told herself, they&#x2019;ll stop the raunchy talk and get down to business. </p><p>But she had no such luck. Even her branch manager, Nicholas Cuneo, amazed and repulsed her by his ability to fashion the F-word into a noun, adjective, verb, and adverb. He was popular throughout the office for announcing impromptu branch parties and for his basement "Boom-Boom Room," where the guys celebrated happy hour. </p><p>Lori learned to hate Monday mornings, when her colleagues tallied their exploits and outdid each other with graphic depictions of their sexual conquests from the weekend. It got to the point that she would feel nauseous the moment she woke up. </p><p>Then a new salesman arrived from the competition down the street, and word got around that he had been fired from his previous job for sexually harassing a sales assistant. "I knew there was a reason I liked this guy," said one senior manager. She let her dad know she was unhappy; tearful sessions several nights running led to a confession that it wasn&#x2019;t just the cold-calling getting to her. </p><p>She finally decided to complain at work. After that, life became impossible. Her mentor sent a memo to all his charges prohibiting the application of makeup and nail polish at their desks and outlawing phone conversations with boyfriends&#x2014;"boyfriends," the memo said&#x2014;on company time. Yet Lori was the only female among them. </p><p>Eventually she was told that she had a problem getting along with men, that there was no future for her as a broker. She resigned after fourteen months in the business. Six months later, her father had left Shearson, too. The chief reason for his departure was a change in corporate ownership, but it had been a slap in the face that they didn&#x2019;t do right by his daughter. If he had known everything that went on at the Boom-Boom Room branch, he never would have let her go to work there.</p></p><h2>Female Spectacle: The Theatrical Roots of Modern Feminism</h2><p><p>When the French actress Sarah Bernhardt made her first American tour in 1880, the term "feminism" had not yet entered our national vocabulary. But over the course of the next half-century, a rising generation of daring actresses and comics brought a new kind of woman to center stage. Exploring and exploiting modern fantasies and fears about female roles and gender identity, these performers eschewed theatrical convention and traditional notions of womanly modesty. They created powerful images of themselves as ambitious, independent, and sexually expressive "New Women."</p><p><i>Female Spectacle</i> reveals the theater to have been a powerful new source of cultural authority and visibility for women. Ironically, theater also provided an arena in which producers and audiences projected the uncertainties and hostilities that accompanied changing gender relations. From Bernhardt's modern methods of self-promotion to Emma Goldman's political theatrics, from the female mimics and Salome dancers to the upwardly striving chorus girl, Glenn shows us how and why theater mattered to women and argues for its pivotal role in the emergence of modern feminism.</p></p><p>Susan A. Glenn is Professor of History at the University of Washington, and author of Daughters of the Shtetl, which won the American Historical Association&#39;s Joan Kelly Prize.All the world may be a stage, but Susan Glenn brilliantly shows us how the stage can shape the world, in this case the modern world of the New Woman from the 1880s through the 1920s. What female performers did on stage and in their professional careers changed forever what all women did off of it. (Lizabeth Cohen, Harvard University)<br><br><i>Female Spectacle</i> is a delightful book that vividly portrays the place of women in the popular theater of the early twentieth century. Engrossing and brilliantly insightful, it will surely be hailed as one of the finest studies of American popular culture to appear in the last decade. (John Kasson, author of <i>Amusing the Million: Coney Island at the Turn of the Century</i>)<br><br><i>Female Spectacle</i> is a richly detailed, lively and original treatment of a fascinating subject. Beautifully researched and persuasively argued, it is also fun to read. (Elizabeth Blackmar, Columbia University)<br><br><i>Female Spectacle</i> is a major contribution to the limited literature of women and the American stage. Susan Glenn has offered important insights into the place of feminism in twentieth-century American theater. (Brooks McNamara, New York University)<br><br><i>Female Spectacle</i> excavates a long-forgotten world and recreates it for us as the glittering, charming, funny theater it was for Americans a century ago. Susan Glenn's insights into the importance of the first female star system for the making of modern American womanhood are enthralling. A book full of surprises, wonders, and show-stopping insights. (Christine Stansell, author of <i>American Moderns: Bohemian New York and the Creation of a New Century</i>)<br><br>Glenn prods readers into thinking about women's demands for roles in public life...As with the best history, Glenn's research sheds light on both past events and present dilemmas. Her argument and research thus provide an important historical context for the recent flood of memoirs about feminist activism in the 1960s-1990s. (L.D.

How is the food prepared? How will it be served?</li> <li>How is it presented in relationship to other food on the plate?</li> <li>How much will it cost?</li> </ul> <p>Plating exposes a chef&#x2019;s deepest beliefs about what food is, and how food should be.

The sculpting mastery of chefs Finch and Maxfield, combined with the concise writing ability of Chef Garlough, make for a truly remarkable text on ice sculpture. Unlike other ice sculpting books on the market, this text was specifically formatted for the classroom learner, with chapter features that include key word lists and parts, consisting of thirteen chapters, that lead the reader through the foundation basics to advanced skill training. Another inspired feature of Ice Sculpting the Modern Way is its approach to teaching the craft of ice sculpting. Students are given insights and exercises relative to the art of sculpting, prior to touching the ice. Students learn about the sculpting process, and are provided with exercises to improve their sculpting skills. The use of modern power tools makes this text truly unique among sub-zero art books. The authors honor the past with a respectful treatment of the traditional ice tools: handsaw, chipper and chisels. However, this text emphasizes the use of power tools to masterfully create the ice pieces. No other text on the market goes into such detail using power tools.</p><p>Chapter 1: The Art of Sculpting.

For the past few years he's been doing short, laid-back spots on NPR. This book, sprung from the radio pieces, ``turns out,'' he says, ``to be a fragmentary autobiography.'' Just don't expect the kind of facts you'd get from Current Biography; Pinkwater has more interest in relating anecdotes, or just observing through his own bemused eyes. And so, in mostly one- to three-page bits suitable for reading in the bathroom, Pinkwater muses on or recollects some odd and ordinary moments from his Chicago childhood and later Zen-like art training there, his ``instructional malnutrition'' as a college art-student, his other spells and travels here and there, and his 12 years in Hoboken, ``my spiritual home for the rest of my life''--a ``quaint'' community preoccupied with crime and politics, ``which sometimes overlap,'' and inhabited by ``da-salt-u-da-eart, with some of the highest-grade eccentrics and loonies mixed in.'' Today he lives in an old farmhouse in upstate New York, where he is getting to know the crows, even though ``the guy who owned this little farm before we did had one of those psychoses in which the idea of being in America and killing everything living in the area are mixed in together.'' The book is all small stuff: An entry from recent years tells of his panic on hearing a slow-talking radio guy announce an upcoming concert of music by ``Daniel...Pink...ham.'' In the end, you might not know what Pinkwater's father actually did for a living...or how he met his wife...or much about his writing. But you might feel fond of this wiggy talent who has at least kept you smiling. And Pinkwater fans can have the fun of recognizing germs of his fiction here and there. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>With gently self-deprecating humor, Pinkwater depicts himself as a fledgling Chicago sculptor and a self-proclaimed expert on Zen Buddhism in the '60s, then a "demon painter" in Hoboken, N.J., living in a loft painted entirely pink and making periodic assaults on the New York City art world. This fragmentary memoir is pieced together from short commentaries, most of which originally aired on National Public Radio's All Things Considered . Pinkwater relates comic, heartwarming stories about his Polish Jewish immigrant father's experiences and his own peripatetic boyhood in Tennessee, Los Angeles and Chicago. He reminisces on raccoons on the front porch, a trip to Africa, Maine coonper web cats, egg creams, teaching art in New York City settlement houses and a fellow junior high school pupil whose assertion that he was a martianper web split the class into fist-fighting believers and doubters. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Encyclopedia of Northwest Native Plants for Gardens and Landscapes</h2><p><p>This comprehensive reference describes plants native to the Pacific Northwest&#x2014;the ferns and conifers; annuals, perennials, and grasses; and flowering trees and shrubs that populate and define this distinctive region.

The authors emphasize that they are only including plants native to the region though the climate has favored garden escapees and introduced species that became naturalized &#x201c;wildflowers.&#x201d; This is not a field guide but a set of notes for the gardener, landscape designer, or land manager who may be selecting plants for specific settings or habitats or to produce a particular artistic effect.&nbsp; The entries are divided into five categories (ferns, conifers, annuals, perennials, and shrubs and trees) and include scientific and common names, hardiness zones, descriptions, cultivation and propagation tips, native range(s) in the Northwest, and, frequently, notes about the plant.&nbsp;Entries are accompanied&nbsp;by color photographs and, in some cases, drawings. With all its differences in elevation, moisture, temperature gradients, and aspects, the Pacific Northwest requires a complex climate-zone map,&nbsp;found in the introductory section along with remarks on the ecosystems.&nbsp;In addition to the individual descriptions, there are lists of suggested plants for drought tolerance,&nbsp;shade, meadows, rock gardens, hummingbirds, sandy areas,&nbsp;erosion control, and other specific situations and purposes.

In these volumes the word is personified in the woman Yael, silence in her still-born child Elya. Even though words imply ambiguity and lies, they are the home of the exile. A book becomes the Book, fragments of the law that are in some way unified, where past and present, the visionary, and the common place, encounter each other.

The events of September 11, 2001, had their origins in both the recent history of the Middle East and in events that took place hundreds of years ago in Europe and elsewhere. The writing collected in Confronting Fear provides the broadest possible basis to probe and understand these horribly destructive acts&#x2014;whose purpose and rationale is complex and sometimes even contradictory&#x2014;by offering both a perceptive and comprehensive long view. It gets into the mind of the terrorist, from those who present terrorism as a tool against the status quo to those who see it as a tool to bolster the status quo to those who insist terrorism is a purely ideological act. Confronting Fear includes portraits from a global rogue's gallery of terrorism, including Robespierre, Lawrence of Arabia, Abu Nidal, Carlos the Jackal, The Red Army, Theodore Kaczynski, Aum Shinrikyo, and Osama bin Laden. There are also discussions of movements that are or have been based in Japan, Russia, Germany, France, Ireland, Algeria, the United States, Afghanistan, Israel, and Palestine, with writings by experts and literary figures ranging from Simon Schama, T. E. Lawrence, and Joseph Conrad to Menachem Begin and V.S. Naipaul.</p><p>This mistitled book is less a history than a compilation of writings on various forms of terrorism--political, religious, and "fringe," such as the Unabomber. Cronin, who has written eight books, including a study on American prison life, has an eye for drama in his selections. After a very short introduction (which is basically only a glossary), he begins with what he calls "prehistory," which takes us all the way back to the 1890s and the Greenwich Observatory Bombing of 1894, as well as the assassination of President McKinley. Much more to the point is an essay by Patrick Seale, which is based on his book <i>Abu Nidal: A Gun for Hire</i>, which provides an inside look at a major terrorist group. This is a good volume to have at hand in today's uncertain world as a quick reference to various instant newsmakers who populate our "Breaking News" mindset. <i>Allen Weakland</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

They both grew up as French Jews in Algeria and share a "belonging constituted of exclusion and nonbelonging"&#x2015;not Algerian, rejected by France, their Jewishness concealed or acculturated. In Derrida's family "one never said 'circumcision'but 'baptism,'not 'Bar Mitzvah'but 'communion.'" Judaism cloaked in Catholicism is one example of the undecidability of identity that influenced the thinker whom Cixous calls a "Jewish Saint."<br><br>An intellectual contemporary of Derrida, Cixous's ideas on writing have an affinity with his philosophy of deconstruction, which sought to overturn binary oppositions&#x2015;such as man/woman, or Jew/non-Jew&#x2015;and blur boundaries of exclusion inherent in Western thought. In portraying Derrida, Cixous uses metonymy, alliteration, rhyme, neologisms, and puns to keep the text in constant motion, freeing language from any rigidity of meaning. In this way she writes a portrait of "Derrida in flight," slipping from one appearance to the next, unable to be fixed in one spot, yet encompassing each point he passes. From the circumcision act to family relationships, through Derrida's works to those of Celan, Rousseau, and Beaumarchais, Cixous effortlessly merges biography and textual commentary in this playful portrait of the man, his works, and being (or not being) Jewish.</p><p>A kaleidoscopic portrait of Derrida&#39;s life and works through the prism of his Jewish heritage, by a leading feminist thinker and close personal friend.

The dominant evangelical sentiment of the day interpreted such sufferings as part of God's plan and, not wanting to interfere with the dispensations of providence, governments took a harsh, stand-on-your-own-feet attitude towards social underdogs, whether they were bankrupts or paupers. In this work, Hilton studies how the transformation of religious thought--including new ideas about the nature of God and the Atonement--affected the economics, philosophy, science, and politics of the period.<br></p><p>Boyd Hilton is at Trinity College, Cambridge.<br>"Hilton's fascinating, ambitious book does much more to lighten our darkness about the broader significance of evangelicalism....A persuasive and thought-provoking book."--<em>Journal of British Studies</em><p></p><br>"Once the envy subsides, religious historians who open this extraordinary and arresting book will be strongly tempted to read it twice: once for the persuasive argument it makes about its subject, and a second time for the sheer pleasure of observing intellectual history...practiced at the very highest levels of insight and erudition....No subsequent discussion of society or religion in the age can properly begin without [this book]."--<em>Church History</em><p></p><br>"Historians of this period are going to have to take account of Hilton's careful reading of evangelical theology and its economic implications....This important book confronts us with a puzzling mixture of unresolved relationships between religious values, social classes, material conditions, scientific ideas, and individual consciences. One of the great virtues of this volume is that it forces us to address the dilemma with abundant new information and a renewed sense of urgency."--<em>Albion</em><p></p><br>"As a contribution to our understanding of nineteenth-century British culture, <em>The Age of Atonement</em> is undoubtedly a study of extraordinary importance and distinction."--<em>Journal of British Studies</em><p></p><br>"A wide-ranging, subtle, and richly rewarding study that can be pursued through several strands....This major work of intellectual and cultural history should be in all scholarly libraries and will be well worth the serious attention of students of this period."--<em>Religious Studies Review</em><p></p><br>"An exceptionally well-researched book, with a wide-ranging approach to its subject. exploring many avenues, often ususual ones."--<em>The Tablet</em><p></p><br>"Boyd Hilton has written a rich, stimulating, often-fascinating, if rather old-fashioned, intellectual history....An engaging, provocative, first-rate book whose many novel facets cannot be appreciated in a short review but should certainly be explored by students of Victorian culture."--<em>American</em> <em>Historical Review</em><p></p><br>"Dr. Hilton's general thesis contains an important truth, and it throws a bold and unconventional light across the whole of nineteenth-century British intellectual history."--<em>The Catholic Historical Review</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Glimpses of the Moon</h2><p>In this classic 1920s novel of manners, a couple with excellent connections but very little capital seeks hungrily after ever-elusive social acceptance. Reissue.</p><p>Set in the 1920s, Glimpses of the Moon details the romantic misadventures of Nick Lansing and Susy Branch, a couple with the right connections but not much in the way of funds. They devise a shrewd bargain: they&#39;ll marry and spend a year or so sponging off their wealthy friends, honeymooning in their mansions and villas. As Susy explains, &#34;We should really, in a way, help more than hamper each other. We both know the ropes so well; what one of us didn&#39;t see the other might - in the way of opportunities, I mean&#34;. The other part of the plan states that if either one of them meets someone who can advance them socially, they&#39;re free to dissolve the marriage. How their plan unfolds is a comedy of eros that will charm all fans of Wharton&#39;s work.Edith Wharton was born in 1862 in New York, into a rich and socially prominent family. She began to write at an early age, although it was a habit viewed by her family as unsuitable for a woman of her social class. In 1885 she married Edward &#34;Teddy&#34; Wharton, a Boston banker. They lived a privileged life, but Wharton gradually grew dissatisfied with the roles of wife and society matron. The Whartons moved to Paris in 1907 and divorced in 1913. Edith continued to live in France, her beloved adoptive home, until her death in 1937.</p><h2>In the City of the Marabouts: Islamic Culture in West Africa</h2><p>From the opening pages, amidst the throes of Ramadan during the hottest and driest season in Mali, Dutch ethnographer Geert Mommersteeg welcomes readers into the religious culture of a historic city uniquely filled with Islamic scholars known as marabouts. This finely crafted English-language translation provides a remarkable contribution to the study of Islamic practices and beliefs observed in local contexts in sub-Saharan Africa, with a focus on the interrelationship between public and secret knowledge of maraboutage in everyday reality.<p> This inviting personal narrative of an anthropologist's long-term fieldwork in Djenn�for centuries a center of West African culture, scholarship, and architecture�is full of valuable methodological insights. Mommersteeg, with unassuming honesty, becomes absorbed in the knowledge of the Holy Word and slowly enters the closed world of religious practice in which marabouts serve as intermediaries between God and their clients. While marabouts do not claim to be all-knowing, they do know how God can be addressed most effectively, which amulets are the most powerful, and which alms are best for nudging the future in the right direction.</p></p><p>"The highly accessible style of this book makes it a delightful read for anyone with an interest in West Africa, Islam and magic." --Trevor H.

Long, Fellowship Urban Outreach</p><h2>The New Urban Renewal: The Economic Transformation of Harlem and Bronzeville</h2><p>Two of the most celebrated black neighborhoods in the United States&#x2014;Harlem in New York City and Bronzeville in Chicago&#x2014;were once plagued by crime, drugs, and abject poverty. But now both have transformed into increasingly trendy and desirable neighborhoods with old buildings being rehabbed, new luxury condos being built, and banks opening branches in areas that were once redlined. In <i>The New Urban Renewal</i>, Derek S. Hyra offers an illuminating exploration of the complicated web of factors&#x2014;local, national, and global&#x2014;driving the remarkable revitalization of these two iconic black communities.&nbsp;How did these formerly notorious ghettos become dotted with expensive restaurants, health spas, and chic boutiques? And, given that urban renewal in the past often meant displacing African Americans, how have both neighborhoods remained black enclaves? Hyra combines his personal experiences as a resident of both communities with deft historical analysis to investigate who has won and who has lost in the new urban renewal. He discovers that today&#x2019;s redevelopment affects African Americans differentially: the middle class benefits while lower-income residents are priced out. Federal policies affecting this process also come under scrutiny, and Hyra breaks new ground with his penetrating investigation into the ways that economic globalization interacts with local political forces to massively reshape metropolitan areas.<br>As public housing is torn down and money floods back into cities across the United States, countless neighborhoods are being monumentally altered. <i>The New Urban Renewal</i> is a compelling study of the shifting dynamics of class and race at work in the contemporary urban landscape.</p><p><p><b>Derek S. Hyra</b> is&nbsp;associate professor in the Department of Public Administration and Policy at American University.</p>&#x201c;<i>The New Urban Renewal</i> will change the way many people think about socioeconomic stratification within black America.&nbsp;Derek Hyra&#x2019;s study of the local, national, and global factors that led to the economic transformation of two historic black communities is insightful.&nbsp;And many of his findings on how this revitalization affected relations between the black poor and the black middle are original.&nbsp;It is an important addition to the burgeoning literature on intraracial class conflict.&#x201d; (William Julius Wilson, author of When Work Disappears: The World of the New Urban Poor)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>The New Urban Renewal</i> is not only a close-up look at two neighborhoods, it is also a broad account of how the sources of change in Bronzeville and Harlem are located in downtowns, D.C., and even more distant places as workers in the global economy demand more and more space in central cities. This is a really ambitious study with tremendous analytical payoff.&#x201d; (Mary Pattillo, author of Black on the Block: The Politics of Race and Class in the City)<br><br>&#x201c;Derek Hyra&#x2019;s wide-ranging study tells two important and interesting stories. One is a progress report on the now ongoing gentrification of poor neighborhoods in America&#x2019;s two major black ghettoes. The other, as the title implies, suggests a new installment of the &#x2018;Negro Removal&#x2019; that began in the 1950s.&#x201d; (Herbert J. Gans, author of Imagining America in 2033: How the Country Put Itself Together after Bush)<br><br>"[Hyra] gives us an interesting and nuanced picture of how urban change impacts people&#x2019;s lives, and he reminds us that the growing prosperity of a place may leave many people behind." (Edward Glaeser <i>New York Sun</i>)<br><br>"[Hyra] provides a valuable addition to the existing urban studies literature . . . by analyzing the redevelopment of Harlem in New York and Bronzeville in Chicago. . . . The author convincingly shows how economic globalization, national political and economic factors, and local political forces all interact to produce varied outcomes." (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>"For historians the book is a welcome addition to the study of the African American urban experience. . . . A fascinating examination&nbsp; of what is happening to two historic black communities and to race relations." (Richard J.Meister <i>Journal of American History</i>)<br><br>"Essential reading for gentrification scholars, as well as for scholars of urban affairs, economics, and politics. In addition, given Hyra's clear prose and the fascinating puzzle that frames the book--why gentrification unfolds differently in two similar neighborhoods--the book would be a fruitful addition to graduate and undergraduate syllabi in a variety of fields. Indeed, students would do well to read Hyra's account, for it is sure to leave a lasting mark on gentrification debate and policy." (J. Brown-Saracino <i>American Journal of Sociology</i>)<br><br>"<i>New Urban Renewal</i> greatly advances our understanding of how and why urban neighborhoods change. Both the methods and the results of this study are innovative contributions to the field of urban sociology. Through its multilayered comparative approach, <i>New Urban Renewal</i> reveals the global, national, and local processes responsible for transforming low-income black neighborhoods into gentrified communities. . . . It is written with clear, straightforward language that makes it easily accessible to undergraduates and of sufficient theoretical rigor to engage graduate students. [It] will be of particular value to courses, scholars, and individuals focused on community development, race and class stratification, and urban politics." (Kesha S.

But their prowess in battle is only a small part of their story, which stretches from their Scandinavian origins to America in the West and as far as Baghdad in the East. As the Vikings did not write their own history, we have to discover it for ourselves; and that discovery, as Neil Oliver reveals, tells an extraordinary story of a people who, from the brink of destruction, reached a quarter of the way around the globe and built an empire that lasted nearly two hundred years.</p><p>Drawing on discoveries that have only recently come to light, Scottish archaeologist Neil Oliver goes on the trail of the real Vikings. Where did they emerge from? How did they really live? And just what drove them to embark on such extraordinary voyages of discovery over a thousand years ago? <em>The Vikings: A New History</em> explores many of those questions for the first time in an epic story of one of the world&#x2019;s great empires of conquest.</p> 16 pages of color and B&amp;W photographs</p><p>is a Scottish archaeologist, historian, broadcaster, and writer.

Not the scholarly type, the Vikings left only scant runes as their written record. Scottish archaeologist and historian Oliver takes clues from their contemporaries, burial remnants, and other cultural activities to tell their story. Instead of assuming the perspectives of the terrified writer of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, or Alcuin, or the Venerable Bede, or Tacitus, he takes the opposite point of view. And though one might question the objectivity of an author so clearly enamored with his subject, the result is a fascinating tale of explorers, chieftains, warlords, and a resourceful, stalwart people of immense seafaring prowess. Beginning before the sacking of Lindisfarne in C.E. 793, Oliver details their exploits from Kiev to Newfoundland, and the startling way they may have affected the Battle of Hastings in 1066&#x2014;thereby changing the course of history&#x2014;all of which makes for riveting reading. Though the book&amp;'s organization is somewhat choppy, anyone interested in finding out more about these real-life raiders will enjoy everything Oliver reveals.

These characters inhabit an amoral universe where beauty reflects no truth and love is an empty delusion. Each character is ultimately annihilated by their own obsessions.<br><br>Acclaimed and reviled when it exploded on the Quebec literary scene in 1959, <i>Mad Shadows</i> initiated a new era in Quebec fiction.</p><p>Marie-Claire Blais was born in Quebec City in 1939. Blais&#x2019; first novel, <b>Mad Shadows</b> (1959), amounted to a literary revolution in Quebec. The book ushered in a new era in Quebec fiction with its nightmarish depiction of the obsessions and evils of society. Her writings, which have won international acclaim, have been translated into 13 languages.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i><b>One</b><br><br>The<br>train<br>was<br>leaving<br>town.<br>Lying back with his head against his mother&#x2019;s shoulder, Patrice followed the dappled countryside with a melancholy expression. Behind his forehead everything grew confused, like a billowing stormcloud on a screen. He watched in silence and did not understand, but his idiot face was so dazzling that it made one think of genius. His mother caressed the nape of his neck with the palm of her hand. With a gentle slip of her all-too-supple wrist she could lower Patrice&#x2019;s head to her bosom and hear his breathing more easily.<br><br>On the other side, aloof and motionless, her daughter Isabelle-Marie sat pressing her sharp features against the window. Louise often said to herself, &#x201c;Isabelle-Marie never really had the face of a child . . . But Patrice . . . Oh, Patrice!&#x201d;<br><br>Isabelle-Marie was thirteen. She was tall and emaciated; her alarming eyes, so often full of anger, seemed glued to black bone. When she scowled, the lower part of her face twisted into a look of fierce contempt. It was almost frightening.<br><br>Her mother Louise, who was rich and owned many farms, gave her daughter all the most menial chores in order to devote her life and her remaining youth to Patrice. One could see that Louise believed in herself and above all, to the point of obsession, in the beauty of Patrice.<br><br>In the seats nearby, the passengers were looking at her son. Weary of having nothing to think about, the child yielded to sleep, gently, with a drop of perspiration on his brow. Louise wiped the drop away with the tip of her finger and smiled with pride at the thought that the beauty of her son was becoming ever more devastating, to even the coldest onlooker.<br><br>&#x201c;Patrice . . . such a magnificent child!&#x201d;<br><br>At the same moment, Isabelle-Marie thought, Patrice, the Idiot!<br><br>Patrice did not seem to worry about himself. He pressed even closer to his mother, his large green eyes empty as the night. Now and then his eyelashes and his cheeks would tremble, suddenly, and not in unison. His forehead was white, intact, and soft as the thigh of a swan. His bare lips curved without the slightest trace of tension. Never was there a sign of life on these lips. The lips of a corpse. Isabelle-Marie cast a sly look at him.<br><br>&#x201c;A Beautiful Beast!&#x201d; she muttered between her teeth.<br><br>Louise did not question the intelligence of her ten-year-old Adonis. He spoke very little, but she attributed this speechlessness, like the silence of the gods, to unconcern.<br><br>His extraordinary beauty satisfied her every wish. Nevertheless, Patrice was an idiot. Isabelle-Marie knew that behind his pale forehead was the deep stupor of an inactive mind, the lethargy of a dead brain. How cold it must be beneath his skin, she thought and was ashamed to see him sleeping peacefully, protected by his mother&#x2019;s shoulder. She knew that the woman&#x2019;s eyes, indeed her whole being, rested on this solitary and fragile beauty.<br><br>The passengers never stopped looking at Patrice. Isabelle-Marie began to blush. She felt sick to her stomach. Soon she saw nothing outside the window. A strange desire to die came over her. She rose and pressed against the cold glass. Her bruised cheek shivered. In an awkward attempt to hide her trembling, Isabelle-Marie clawed at the pane with her nails, trying to hold onto it . . . Louise did not see her. Louise never really dared look at her. Finally Isabelle-Marie buried her face in her hands.<br><br>&#x201c;Mother, I have a fever.&#x201d;<br><br>Bewildered, physically terrified by the people around her, she heard a woman cry out, &#x201c;What a handsome son you have!&#x201d;<br><br>And Louise, in her contented voice, answered, &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t he, though?&#x201d;<br><br>Isabelle-Marie fainted.<br><br>When she opened her eyes, they were drawing into the station. The other passengers, she was relieved to discover, had forgotten about the beauty of her brother. They walked hurriedly toward the station, paying no attention to one another. Isabelle-Marie began to breathe again. Blood warmed her legs and she felt a sense of release, a crazy desire to burst out laughing now that the torture had ceased.<br><br>&#x201c;What is it, Isabelle-Marie?&#x201d; asked Louise in a deceitful tone of voice.<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing at all, Mother. Only a slight dizziness . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Louise held her son&#x2019;s hand nested in her own and the two of them slipped through the crowd, oblivious of the smoke that filled the air. The blond child followed indolently, his head resting against his mother&#x2019;s elbow. Isabelle-Marie was sorry that the sun cast such an aura of innocence over Patrice&#x2019;s hair.

The crimes have baffled the police and enraged Londoners, who demand the murderer's arrest. Mary, Duchess of Dove, a gentle young widow who is beloved by all who know her, seems an unlikely suspect, but the clues all point to her. The police have a variety of theories - perhaps the Duchess has been hypnotized or drugged, maybe she has an evil double, or could it be a Communist plot to discredit the peerage? Inspector Basil Icelin is determined to solve the mystery, but the true explanation is far more shocking and terrifying than anyone could ever imagine. <br><br> Michael Arlen (1895-1956) became a rich and world-famous celebrity after the publication of his bestseller <i>The Green Hat</i> in 1924. <i>Hell! said the Duchess</i> (1934) is a delightfully bizarre book, telling a "bedtime story" in a light, humorous style that contrasts oddly with its gruesome and horrific subject matter.

In <i>The Dance Claimed Me</i>, Peggy and Murray Schwartz, friends and colleagues of Primus, offer an intimate perspective on her life and explore her influences on American culture, dance, and education. They trace Primus's path from her childhood in Port of Spain, Trinidad, through her rise as an influential international dancer, an early member of the New Dance Group (whose motto was "Dance is a weapon"), and a pioneer in dance anthropology.</p><p>Primus traveled extensively in the United States, Europe, Israel, the Caribbean, and Africa, and she played an important role in presenting authentic African dance to American audiences. She engendered controversy in both her private and professional lives, marrying a white Jewish man during a time of segregation and challenging black intellectuals who opposed the "primitive" in her choreography. Her political protests and mixed-race tours in the South triggered an FBI investigation, even as she was celebrated by dance critics and by contemporaries like Langston Hughes.</p><p>For <i>The Dance Claimed Me</i>, the Schwartzes interviewed more than a hundred of Primus's family members, friends, and&nbsp;fellow artists,&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;other individuals to create a vivid portrayal of a life filled with passion, drama, determination, fearlessness, and brilliance.</p></p><p><b>Peggy Schwartz</b> is professor emeritus of dance and former director of the dance program at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. <b>Murray Schwartz</b> is former dean of humanities and fine arts at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

We see her electrifying performance at the first Negro rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City, where she became moon and prayer. Rain. Thunder. Light on the world stage. We feel the pulse of this twentieth century African-American woman claiming the dance of her people for all people and we chant Amen. Amen. A woman. A woman."&#x2014;Sonia Sanchez, author of <i>Morning Haiku</i> (Sonia Sanchez)<br><br> <p>"<i>The Dance Claimed Me</i> is at once an invaluable contribution to the cultural history of American dance as well as a scintillating account of an extraordinary life. As dancer, a force majeure; as choreographer, a culturally groundbreaking and influential innovator; as devotee and tireless teacher of traditional African cultural values, Mama Pearl Primus was the embodiment of black consciousness and womanhood at its very best. &nbsp;All of which emerges powerfully from these pages.&#x201d;&#x2014;Ekwueme Michael Thelwell, author of <i>The Harder They Come</i></p><p></p> (Ekwueme Michael Thelwell)<br><br> <p>"Peggy and Murray have taken the great, complicated life and legacy of Pearl Primus and given us a way to learn, breathe and feel Pearl's life journey.

When she's not traipsing after a rabbit into Wonderland, she's gallivanting off into the topsy-turvy world behind the drawing-room looking glass. In <i>Through the Looking Glass</i>, Lewis Carroll's masterful and zany sequel to <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i>, she makes more eccentric acquaintances, including Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the White Queen, and a somewhat grumpy Humpty Dumpty. Through a giant and elaborate chess game, Alice explores this odd country, where one must eat dry biscuits to quench thirst, and run like the wind to stay in one place. As in life, Alice must stay on her toes to learn the rules of this game. <i>Through the Looking Glass</i> immediately took its rightful place beside its partner on the shelf of eternal classics. And luckily for generations of enraptured children, Carroll was again able to persuade John Tenniel to create the fantastic woodblock engravings that have become so indelibly associated with the Alice stories. For almost 130 years, Alice's curious adventures have amused, perplexed, and delighted readers, young and old. This gorgeous, deluxe boxed set of both volumes contains engravings from Tenniel's original woodblocks that were discovered in a London bank in 1985, and reproduced for the first time here. "'What is the use of a book,' thought Alice, 'without pictures?'" What indeed? (All ages)Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.</p><h2>The History of Modern Mathematics, Volume 2: Institutions and Applications</h2><p>The History of Modern Mathematics, Volume II: Institutions and Applications focuses on the history and progress of methodologies, techniques, principles, and approaches involved in modern mathematics. <br><br>The selection first elaborates on crystallographic symmetry concepts and group theory, case of potential theory and electrodynamics, and geometrization of analytical mechanics. Discussions focus on differential geometry and least action, intrinsic differential geometry, physically-motivated research in potential theory, introduction of potentials in electrodynamics, and group theory and crystallography in the mid-19th century. The text then elaborates on Schouten, Levi-Civita, and emergence of tensor calculus, modes and manners of applied mathematics, and pure and applied mathematics in divergent institutional settings in Germany. Topics include function of mathematics within technical colleges, evolvement of the notion of applied mathematics, rise of technical colleges, and an engineering approach to mechanics. The publication examines the transformation of numerical analysis by the computer; mathematics at the Berlin Technische Hochschule/Technische Universit�t; and contribution of mathematical societies to promoting applications of mathematics in Germany. <br><br>The selection is a valuable reference for mathematicians and researchers interested in the history of modern mathematics.<ul><li>Mathematical institutions in France and Germany and their role in promoting applications</li><li>Relationship between mathematics and physics</li><li>Foundations of mathematics</li><li>Complex variable theory, geometry and topology</li><li>Geometry in the spirit of Klein's Erlangen program</li><li>Algebra and number theory</li><li>Formative influences on mathematics in the United States</li></ul></p><p><p>"These volumes will interest advanced undergraduate and graduate students of the history of mathematics." --<b><i>CHOICE</i></b></p> <p>"Very interesting reading." --<b><i>AMERICAN MATHEMATICAL MONTHLY</i></b></p></p><h2>Text, Cases and Materials on Public Law and Human Rights</h2><p><p>This book interweaves an authoritative authorial commentary &#x2013; significantly expanded from the last edition - with extracts from a diverse and contemporary collection of cases and materials from three leading academics in the field.

The question seems absurd. Darwin, after all, was a naturalist, not an economist. But Robert Frank, New York Times economics columnist and best-selling author of The Economic Naturalist, predicts that within the next century Darwin will unseat Smith as the intellectual founder of economics. The reason, Frank argues, is that Darwin&#39;s understanding of competition describes economic reality far more accurately than Smith&#39;s. And the consequences of this fact are profound. Indeed, the failure to recognize that we live in Darwin&#39;s world rather than Smith&#39;s is putting us all at risk by preventing us from seeing that competition alone will not solve our problems.Smith&#39;s theory of the invisible hand, which says that competition channels self-interest for the common good, is probably the most widely cited argument today in favor of unbridled competition--and against regulation, taxation, and even government itse</p><p><p>"I've been reading Robert Frank's books for years, and he just gets better and better. I strongly recommend<i>The Darwin Economy</i>: it's clear, persuasive, and cleverly entertaining, and it provides a new and original insight about a central issue in economics. Read and enjoy."<b>--Thomas C. Schelling, Nobel Laureate in Economics</b></p><p>"The Darwin Economy debunks popular nostrums of both left and right, and takes particular aim at the notion that a well-functioning competitive market system will necessarily produce socially optimal results. Frank suggests novel approaches to America's problems that go well beyond the tired ideas of the present debate."<b>--Francis Fukuyama, author of<i>The Origins of Political Order</i></b></p><p>"Competition often serves the parts better than the whole. This is true for both species evolution and human society. Only a fool would count on the invisible hand. In his usual clearheaded and lively style, Robert Frank explains how Charles Darwin thought more deeply about these issues than most contemporary economists."<b>--Frans de Waal, author of<i>The Age of Empathy and Our Inner Ape</i></b></p><p>"Pointing to new ways of thinking about collective action and taxation, Robert Frank has given us a book that is as important as it is timely."<b>--Dan Ariely, author of<i>Predictably Irrational</i></b></p><p>"The Darwin Economy's message is in my view the only hope for a rational economic future."<b>--William J. Baumol, past president, American Economic Association</b></p><p>"This lucid, deeply engaging book provides the perfect antidote to the mindless sloganeering that dominates our current discussions about the role of government in a free society."<b>--Dani Rodrik, author of<i>The Globalization Paradox</i></b></p><p>"Robert Frank convincingly predicts that Darwin will eventually be recognized as the true intellectual father of economics.

The author has taken on the formidable task of investigating the scientific theories explaining the innumerable branchings, proliferations, and extinctions of life on planet Earth. His lucid text presents a terse chronology of life from its earliest beginnings as one-celled bacteria in the primordial ocean to the appearance of modern man. He then explains how scientists were persuaded that animal/plant classifications and geological/fossil records provided proof that animals and plants had not remained unchanged since a single moment of creation, and discusses how Charles Darwin's investigations in the Gal&nbsp;pagos resulted in his formulation of the theory of evolution. The discussion also includes natural selection, variation and mutation, and how these processes can produce new species and some of the possible causes of extinctions. The final graphic diagram compares Earth's 4 � billion-year history with a 24-hour day, showing modern man popping into the scene at 11:59:58 p.m. Larger and more eye-catching than Joanna Cole's Evolution (Crowell, 1987; o.p.), and far simpler than Stephen Webster's The Kingfisher Book of Evolution (Kingfisher, 2000), Life on Earth is a polished exposition of a difficult, often controversial scientific concept.

(Jean Hocker <i>President, Conservation Service Company, LLC and President Emeritus, Land Trust Alliance</i>)<br><br>"This book belongs on the director's desk of every environmental group in the country: in it the fear of raising money is replaced by an understanding of what it means to give. Raising money is always about relationships, our relationship toward the land and each other. Who could imagine a book about money to be a book about love?" (Terry Tempest Williams <i>author of The Open Space of Democracy and Refuge</i>)<br><br>"Story Clark begins her wonderfully helpful book by noting that 'conservation finance is the best place where people, land, and money meet,' but it is surely not the only place.

Understanding the action of biological macromolecules (giant molecules) requires detailed knowledge of their structures. Most of the more than ten thousand known structures of protein and nucleic acids were obtained by x-ray crystallography, the standard mechanism for determining protein structure. Essentially, proteins are frozen into rigid crystals, which can be stacked up in a repeating pattern--like supermarket displays. The structure of each individual crystal can be determined by the way x-rays are bent when they pass through the composite crystal. Protein structure is essential when investigating protein interactions and planning drug development. <br><b>Crystallography Made Crystal Clear, Second Edition</b> explains how scientists discover the structures of the macromolecules. Scientists do not see these molecules directly. Instead, they build models as a means of interpreting data from x-ray diffraction by crystals, or by irradiation by other forms of energy. Users of these models need to know how they are obtained in order to know what they are seeing when they study a model of a macromolecule. They also need to know how to judge whether conclusions they draw from the molecular models are really supported by the models. This book uses visual and geometric models to help readers understand the mathematics that forms the basis of x-ray crystallography.<br>The field of protein crystallography is growing every day and has been instrumental in discovering the molecular principles of biology and in discovering new drugs, such as the recent protease inhibitors for AIDS. The field includes the largest percentage of Nobel prizes than any other scientific discipline. Every major university and drug company has a protein crystallography laboratory and this book is an invaluable aid to those wishing to practice protein crystallography<br>or just learn more about how it is actually done. <br><br>Key Features<br>* Provides clear, understandable descriptions of principles of X-ray crystallography<br>* Leads reader through unintimidating and thorough explanations of the underlying mathematics <br>* Provides abundant illustrations, including diagrams, charts, photographs, and color stereo<br>* images<br>* Explains how to read crystallography papers in research journals<br>* Includes brief descriptions of other diffraction methods (neutron, electron, Laue) and the kinds<br>* of structural information they can provide<br>* Introduces other methods of macromolecular structure determination (NMR spectroscopy and<br>* homology modeling), and provides guidance in judging the quality of these models</p><p>Expanded and updated edition uses four-color art and concise language to explain the basis of X-ray crystallographyGale Rhodes makes crystallography accessible to readers who have no prior knowledge of the field, or its mathematical basis.

Not only is the agricultural sector expected to produce adequate food, fiber, and feed, and contribute to biofuels to meet the needs of a rising global population, it is expected to do so under increasingly scarce natural resources and climate change. Growing awareness of the unintended impacts associated with some agricultural production practices has led to heightened societal expectations for improved environmental, community, labor, and animal welfare standards in agriculture.</p> <p><em>Toward Sustainable Agricultural Systems in the 21st Century</em> assesses the scientific evidence for the strengths and weaknesses of different production, marketing, and policy approaches for improving and reducing the costs and unintended consequences of agricultural production.

Mehrez delves into the relationship between history and narrative literature and shows that both attempt to transform &#39;reality&#39; and &#39;life&#39; into historical structures of meaning. By analyzing the works of these authors in terms of the relationship between authority and the production of narrative literature, she reveals a context in which literature becomes a kind of &#39;alternative&#39; history - a discourse that comments not only on the history of a place but also on the creation of a narrative on history.

She has owned her critically acclaimed restaurant, Zarela, since 1987. She lives in New York City, where she is working on her second book.The author, proprietor of the Zarela restaurant in New York City, promises "a memoir, a guide to Mexican culinary basics, and a personal recipe collection, all interspersed with glimpse-by-glimpse evocations of Mexican life and culture." She keeps the promise. Recipes and techniques are here in abundance, yet the book is truly for those who always wished that culinary introductions, notes and sidelights on appreciation would never end. Martinez delivers both personal reminiscence and cultural insight with the taste and candor of an experienced hostess--a memoir of a family servant nestles up with a fiercely patriotic sidebar on the "Manana Syndrome." Raised among Sonora's ranching aristocracy ("By the time I was 14 I was busting broncos"), she shows how she came to immerse herself in her country's food traditions and--beginning with modest catering projects--soon found herself lionized in New York by the likes of Paul Prudhomme and Craig Claiborne. Her approach is not one of ethnic purity or "authenticity" understood narrowly; she blithely combines traditions from different regions within single recipes, "my own personal process of mestizajesic , synthesis." And, indeed, she attributes the makings of her crab enchilada to a chef for a California restaurant chain. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Daring to Dream: Toward a Pedagogy of the Unfinished (Series in Critical Narrative)</h2><p>-- New from the author of the million-selling Pedagogy of the Oppressed -- In an era when teachers and states are resisting high-stakes testing, this new book from world-renowned author Paulo Freire could not be more timely.

Tour.</p><p>If Joseph McCarthy hadn't existed, someone would have had to invent him--the communist witch-hunt he unleashed on 1950s America was, after all, the stuff of epic fiction. Now, it seems, someone <i>has</i> invented the senator from Wisconsin, or at least revised him. And that someone is none other than archconservative political pundit and sometime novelist William F. Buckley Jr., whose 12th work of fiction presents McCarthy in what many readers will consider an original light: that of a hero. <p> To do so, Buckley starts stacking his deck very early. In a prologue to <i>The Redhunter</i>, a history professor and former McCarthy colleague named Harry Bontecou sits reading a newspaper in a London club. The year is 1991, and as Harry muses over reports of Khmer Rouge atrocities, his mind wanders to the similar carnages committed by Stalin, the Nazis, and the East Germans. Only the arrival of an old, not entirely welcome acquaintance interrupts his reverie: </p><blockquote> "Say." The insistent tone was off register in the quiet of the Garrick Club. One had the impression the leather volumes winced at Tracy's voice. "Didn't you used to be Harry Bontecou?" </blockquote> Obviously the leather volumes are prescient, for the reader soon realizes that Tracy Allshott is both drunk and boorish. After unsuccessfully baiting Bontecou on his early support of McCarthy, he announces priggishly that "there were those of us back in the fifties during the anti-Communist hysteria who were far-sighted and courageous enough to resist McCarthy and McCarthyism." <p> Whether it is Allshott's ungentlemanly accusations or an ensuing conversation with a repentant former Soviet spy, Harry soon resolves to tell his version of the McCarthy years and <i>The Redhunter</i> really starts to roll. Buckley is too accomplished a writer to hand us a Joseph McCarthy free of sin--indeed, as the story of the senator's life unfolds, we are made privy to such offenses as the teenaged Joe hiring a classmate to take a final exam for him and the young politico Joe stretching the truth to the breaking point in a dirty campaign against his opponent. But the essential morality of the House Un-American Activities Committee is never questioned. In Buckley's view, the threat of Communism was a real one--so real, in fact, that it superceded any notion of due process, free speech, freedom of association, or any of the other little liberties guaranteed in the Constitution. Regardless of how you view McCarthy's actions, however, Buckley's novel offers an entertaining and eye-opening account of his rise and fall, complete with the media frenzy, senate hearings, and back-room maneuverings we've come to expect from literary intrigues Washington-style. This may not be the most objective treatment of the McCarthy years (Buckley ends his novel with a eulogy by Senator Everett Dirksen that describes McCarthy's "reward" for suffering "the vindictive fury which was unleashed against him" as "the living, pulsing shrine of hundreds of thousands of hearts in America"), but for readers with a short memory, it's above average entertainment. <i>--Margaret Prior</i></p>William F.

It is the first such publication since the earlier widely acclaimed books of R. Parks. It systematically reviews the basic physics and recent advances in the field. Leading researchers describe the state of the art in conventional phonon-induced superconductivity, high-Tc superconductivity, and in novel superconductivity, including triplet pairing in the ruthenates. Progress in many-body physics, a topic of central and general interest in physics, is presented in many chapters. Volume 1 primarily addresses conventional and high-Tc superconductivity in the cuprates. Many illustrations, figures and numerous tables are included, making this volume especially useful for students, teachers and researchers. The underlying general theory of superconductivity, including the use of Green&#39;s functions, is also presented for pedagogical completeness. The second volume (ISBN 3-540-44232-4) is largely concerned with novel supercondutors, such as heavy-fermion metals and organic materials, and also includes granular superconductors. Important new results on current problems are presented in a manner designed to stimulate further research. Together these two volumes will take on the role of the new &#39;bible&#39; of superconductivity and should become a standard reference work in the field for many years to come. K.

Some readers say Whittier, others say Poe, and these days an increasing number say Herman Melville. The revaluation of Melville s poetry is due in large part to the influence of this landmark volume, for Melville the Poet has never found a more judicious, eloquent, or persuasive partisan than Robert Penn Warren.<br><br>In 1970, Warren published what was then (and what remains) the most comprehensive selection of Melville s poetry ever presented. The book brings together the best lyrics from Battle-Pieces (1866), John Marr (1888), and Timoleon (1891), as well as many poems unpublished during Melville s lifetime. Central to the selection are many long, self-contained passages from Clarel (1876), the book-length poem that Warren calls "an important document of our modernity . . . In fact, a precursor to The Waste Land, with the same central image, the same flickering contrasts of the past and the present, the same charade of belief and unbelief."<br><br>Warren introduces his selection with a valuable interpretive essay, and also provides copious textual and critical notes. It is a labor of love, this highly personal anthology: as Warren says in the preface, "I have called this book 'A Reader's Edition,' and the reader I refer to is myself. The book may be regarded as a log of my long reading of Melville's poetry, of my preferences, my impressions and speculations, my curiosities and investigations." Warren's Melville is, to our mind, the most important "selected" since Malcolm Cowley s Portable Faulkner. It s a book that not only showcases an American master at his most powerful, but also changes our perception of his work forever. A Nonpareil Book by David R. Godine.</p><p>The entries collected in The Selected Poem of Herman Melville were chosen with literary consideration foremost, but poems of lesser regard also appear in the interest of exploring Melville&#39;s artistic development and their correlation with his novels.Herman Melville was born in New York City and spent much of his life in Massachusetts. Forced by necessity to find work after his father&#39;s death, he spent five years of his youth aboard whaling vessels in the South Pacific. Those five years would influence his life an work more than any other. His 1851 novel Moby Dick is now indubitably included among the classics of American literature. For the last thirty years of his life, however, Melville was all but unknown. The centennial of his birth in 1919 sparked a revival of interest in his work, which led to the legendary status he holds today.</p><h2>Look How It Changes!

In this study, Kawagley follows both memories of his Yupiaq grandmother, who raised him with the stories of the Bear Woman and respectful knowledge of the reciprocity of nature, and his own education in science as it is taught in Western schools. Kawagley is a man who hears the elders&#39; voices in Alaska, knows how to look for the weather and to use the land and its creatures with the most delicate care. In a call to unite the two parts of his own and modern Yupiaq history, Kawagley proposes a way of teaching that incorporates all ways of knowing available in Yupiaq and Western science. He has traveled a long journey, but it ends where it began, in a fishing camp in southwestern Alaska, a home for his heart and spirit.</p><p>Titles of related interest from Waveland Press: Balikci, The Netsilik Eskimo (ISBN 0881334359); Jarvenpa, Northern Passage: Ethnography and Apprenticeship among the Subarctic Dene (ISBN 0881339903); Lancy, Studying Children and Schools: Qualitative Research Traditions (ISBN 1577661702); and Ziker, Peoples of the Tundra: Northern Siberians in the Post-Communist Transition (ISBN 1577662121)."A great book with contemporary issues in politics, economy, and education as well as current adaptations of a native people.

These include the relation between human identity and ideas of the good, the effect of the modern critique of religion on moral thought, the relation between ethics and literature, and the contemporary debate about liberalism. In the most comprehensive engagement with Murdoch's work to date, this volume gathers contributions from philosophers, theologians, and a literary critic to explore the significance of her ideas for contemporary thought.<br> <br> Inspired by Murdoch's tenacious wrestling with basic questions of human existence, these essays not only clarify her thoughts on human goodness, but also move beyond the academy to reflect on how we can and ought to undertake the human adventure in our daily lives.<br> <br> Contributors are Charles Taylor, Martha Nussbaum, David Tracy, Cora Diamond, Maria Antonaccio, Elizabeth Dipple, Franklin I.

Here at the end of the 20th century there is a profound need for ethics to rethink its relation to metaphysics and the concept of human nature, in hopes that they will again give substance to ethics. Essays by such notables as Nussbaum, Hauerwas, and Diamond take on such issues as eros, the fact/value distinction, the relations between ethics and religion, and the ego and action. Murdoch's important essay, "Metaphysics and Ethics," is also included. This work presumes a strong background in philosophy; therefore, the text is suitable for graduate work and advanced scholarship.?Lee Horvitz, Miami Univ., Oxford, Ohio<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Shattered Sense of Innocence: The 1955 Murders of Three Chicago Children (Elmer H Johnson &amp; Carol Holmes Johnson Series in Criminology)</h2><p>In October 1955, three Chicago boys were found murdered, their bodies naked and dumped in a ditch in Robinson Woods on the city&#x2019;s Northwest Side. A community and a nation were shocked. In a time when such crimes against children were rare, the public was transfixed as local television stations aired stark footage of the first hours of the investigation. <i>Life </i>and <i>Newsweek</i> magazines published exclusive stories the following week. When Kenneth Hansen was convicted and sentenced for the murders, the case was considered solved&#x2014;until questions were raised about Hansen&#x2019;s presumed guilt.<br><br><i>Shattered Sense of Innocence: The 1955 Murders of Three Chicago Children </i>tells the gripping story of the three murdered boys&#x2014;thirteen-year-old John Schuessler, his eleven-year-old brother, Anton, and thirteen-year-old Bobby Peterson&#x2014;and the quest to find and bring to justice their killer. Authors Richard C. Lindberg and Gloria Jean Sykes recount the bungled 1955 police investigation, the failures of multiple&nbsp;law enforcement agencies, and the subsequent convictions of Kenneth Hansen, in 1995 and 2002, and present new information concerning two suspects overlooked by police for five decades.<br><br> The authors deftly examine all sides of this tragic story, drawing on exclusive interviews with law enforcement agents, with horse trainers affiliated with the so-called horse mafia, and with the man convicted of the murders, Kenneth Hansen. This intensely intimate account offers a rare glimpse into one community and examines how these atrocious crimes altered public perceptions nationwide. <i>Shattered Sense of Innocence, </i>which is also a story of political controversy, a determined federal agent&#x2019;s quest for justice, and a community&#x2019;s loss of innocence, includes fifty illustrations.<br><br></p><p><b>Richard C. Lindberg</b> is a journalist, a research historian, and the author or a coauthor of thirteen books, including <i>Chicago Yesterday and Today,</i><i>Shattered Sense of Innocence: The 1955 Murders of Three Chicago Children</i> and <i>Return to the Scene of the Crime: A Guide to Infamous Places in Chicago</i>. He is a past president of the Society of Midland Authors and a 2008 recipient of the Morris Wexler Award, presented by the Illinois Academy of Criminology, for his contributions to the field of criminal justice writing.Telling the story of shocking triple murder in Chicago in 1955, Lindberg and Sykes present considerable detail about the families of the boys who were murdered and the sociopolitical forces then at work in the Chicago metro area. They provide information about the Chicago "Horse Mafia," a crime syndicate separate from but acquainted with Chicago's legendary Outfit, and they criticize the investigators, arguing that the panoply of competing investigative units worked against each other, hindering the investigation. Worse, the inexperienced and ham-handed coroner failed to secure the crime scene. Packed with information and raising questions about the man found guilty of the crime, this is an excellent and accessible overview of the confounding crime that put pedophilia on the nation's front pages. <i>Mike Tribby</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The result is a landmark in sociological theory, capable of describing both stability and change in social systems. </p><p> This book provides for the first time a sound theoretical foundation for linking the behavior of individuals to organizational behavior and then to society as a whole. The power of the theory is especially apparent when Coleman analyzes corporate actors, such as large corporations and trade unions. He examines the creation of these institutions, collective decision making, and the processes through which authority is revoked in revolts and revolutions. </p><p> Coleman discusses the problems of holding institutions responsible for their actions as well as their incompatibility with the family. He also provides a simple mathematical analysis corresponding to and carrying further the verbal formulations of the theory. Finally, he generates research techniques that will permit quantitative testing of the theory. </p><p> From a simple, unified conceptual structure Coleman derives, through elegant chains of reasoning, an encompassing theory of society. It promises to be the most important contribution to social theory since the publication of Talcott Parsons' Structure of Social Action in 1936. </p></p><p>This book provides for the first time a sound theoretical foundation for linking the behavior of individuals to organizational behavior and then to society as a whole.

Epic in scope, it is clear, engaging, and forcefully argued. Traditional sociologists will be unable to ignore its bold new agenda for their discipline. And the book will have a lasting impact on economics, political science, psychology, and other disciplines concerned with human behavior...[It] is indeed a fitting capstone to the career of one of this century's most distinguished and creative sociologists. (Robert H. Frank <i>Journal of Economic Literature</i>)<br><br>A landmark in the history of social theory, combining comprehensive scope with depth and precision of analysis...This is a work which builds upon and deepens virtually all of Coleman's extensive earlier sociological research...This lifetime corpus, culminating now in a theoretical synthesis, assures Coleman a place in the history of sociology on at least an equal level with Weber, Durkheim, and a few others: he is a master of sociological thought...This is a book for our time. Every social scientist will want to read and learn from it. (Thomas J. Fararo <i>Social Science Quarterly</i>)<br><br>The most important book in social theory in a long time. Coleman demonstrates formally and with numerous examples that a rational choice model of behavior has enormous power in explaining social phenomena. This book will give sociology a strong push in a new direction. (Gary S. Becker <i>Nobel Laureate, University of Chicago</i>)<br><br>Coleman's study...exhibits some magnificent achievements. The foremost of these is a sophisticated elaboration and extension of the research program of rational choice theory as it applies to corporate actors, both public and private...This is an ambitious, highly intelligent, intellectually honest, and morally uplifting book.

Accompanying a centennial retrospective of her work, this volume contains full-color reproductions of Albers&#39;s most important weavings, drapery materials and wall coverings, as well as scores of her highly influential commercial textile designs. Anni Albers had an enormous effect on the design of yard materials worldwide. A comprehensive illustrated chronology details her fascinating life and career in Germany and in the United States, where she moved in the 1930s with her husband, the famed painter and instructor Josef Albers.</p><p>Anni Albers is undoubtedly the most widely known textile artist of the 20th century. Her Bauhaus-inspired aesthetic, like that of her husband, painter Josef Albers, has been tremendously influential in both art and design. This publication accompanies a centennial exhibition of Albers's weaving and printmaking showing at the Jewish Museum in New York after stops in Venice and Paris. The text and plates provide a solid overview of Albers's life, work, and beliefs. Weber, director of the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation and friend of both Albers and her husband at the end of their lives, contributes an affectionate memoir. A cogent summary of Albers's artwork and its impact by art historian Virginia Gardner Troy is accessible to general readers, but a technical section by Jean-Paul Leclercq uses specialized language that will not be understood by those without a technical knowledge of weaving.

This sixth edition has kept that basic philosophy. For the fundamental circuits, we have continued to use devices that are readily available, easy to use, and forgiving if a wiring error is made. Newer devices are introduced where the application requires it. We have preserved our original objective of simplifying the process of learning about applications involving signal conditioning, signal generation, filters, instrumentation, timing, and control circuits. This edition continues to reflect the evolution of analog circuits into applications requiring transducer signals that must be conditioned for a microcontroller's analog-to-digital input. We have kept circuit simulation using OrCAD� PSpice�. A laboratory manual is now available to accompany this sixth edition. It includes both detailed hardware and simulation exercises. Some exercises are step-by-step; others are design projects. The exercises follow the text material. </p> <p> Chapters 1 through 6 provide the reader with a logical progression from op amp fundamentals to a variety of practical applications without having to worry about op amp limitations. Chapter 7 shows how op amps combined with diodes can be used to design ideal rectifier circuits as well as clamping and clipping circuits. PSpice models and simulations are included in these chapters. </p> <p> Chapter 8 shows applications that require measuring a physical variable such as temperature, force, pressure, or weight and then having the signal conditioned by an instrumentation amplifier before being input into a microcontroller's A/D converter. Instrumentation amplifiers are required when a designer has to measure a differential signal, especially in the presence of a larger noise signal. </p> <p> As previously mentioned, in order not to obscure the inherent simplicity and overwhelming advantages of using op amps, their limitations have been left for Chapters 9 and 10. Dc limitations are studied in Chapter 9 and ac limitations are covered in Chapter 10. An expanded discussion on common-mode rejection ratio has been included in this edition. Many limitations have been made negligible by the latest generations of op amps, as pointed out in these chapters. </p> <p> Active filters, low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, and band-reject, are covered in Chapter 11. Butterworth-type filters were selected because they are easy to design and produce a maximally flat response in the pass band. Chapter 11 shows the reader how to design a variety of filters easily and quickly. </p> <p> Chapter 12 introduces a linear integrated circuit known as the multiplier. The device makes analysis and design of AM communication circuits simpler than using discrete components. Modulators, demodulators, frequency shifters, a universal AM radio receiver, and analog divider circuits all use a multiplier IC as the system's basic building block. This chapter has been retained because instructors have written to say that the principles of single-side band suppressed carrier and standard amplitude-modulation transmission and detection are clearly explained and quite useful for their courses. </p> <p> The inexpensive 555 IC timer is covered in Chapter 13. This chapter shows the basic operation of the device as well as many practical applications. The chapter also includes a timer/counter unit. </p> <p> In previous editions, analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters have been covered in a single chapter. This edition separates these topics into two chapters so that more device specifications can be included as well as practical applications. Chapter -14 deals only with analog-to-digital converters, while the new Chapter 15 covers digital-to-analog converters. A serial ADC connected to a Motorola microprocessor is shown (with assembly language code) in Chapter 14. </p> <p> Chapter 16 shows how to design a regulated linear power supply. This chapter begins with the fundamentals of unregulated supplies and proceeds to regulated supplies. It shows how IC regulators are used for building low-cost 5 V and � 15 V bench supplies. </p> <p> This edition has more than enough material for a single-semester course. After the first three chapters, instructors often take chapters out of sequence depending on the class interest, need to complement another course (such as a design course), or availability of lab equipment or class time. Therefore, Chapters 4 through 16 have been written as standalone chapters for this very reason.

As per APA recommendations, emphasis is also placed on data exploration, effect size measures, confidence intervals, and using power analyses to determine sample size. "Real-world" data sets are used to illustrate data exploration, analysis, and interpretation. The book offers a rare blend of the underlying statistical assumptions, the consequences of their violations, and practical advice on dealing with them.</p> <p>Changes in the New Edition:</p> <ul> <li>Each section of the book concludes with a chapter that provides an integrated example of how to apply the concepts and procedures covered in the chapters of the section. In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of alternative designs are discussed.</li> <li>A new chapter (1) reviews the major steps in planning and executing a study, and the implications of those decisions for subsequent analyses and interpretations.</li> <li>A new chapter (13) compares experimental designs to reinforce the connection between design and analysis and to help readers achieve the most efficient research study.</li> <li>A new chapter (27) on common errors in data analysis and interpretation.</li> <li>Increased emphasis on power analyses to determine sample size using the G*Power 3 program.</li> <li>Many new data sets and problems.</li> <li>More examples of the use of SPSS (PASW) Version 17, although the analyses exemplified are readily carried out by any of the major statistical software packages.</li> <li>A companion website with the data used in the text and the exercises in SPSS and Excel formats; SPSS syntax files for performing analyses; extra material on logistic and multiple regression; technical notes that develop some of the formulas; and a solutions manual and the text figures and tables for instructors only.</li></ul> <p>Part 1 reviews research planning, data exploration, and basic concepts in statistics including sampling, hypothesis testing, measures of effect size, estimators, and confidence intervals.&nbsp; Part 2 presents between-subject designs. The statistical models underlying the analysis of variance for these designs are emphasized, along with the role of expected mean squares in estimating effects of variables, the interpretation of nteractions, and procedures for testing contrasts and controlling error rates. Part 3 focuses on repeated-measures designs and considers the advantages and disadvantages of different mixed designs. Part 4 presents detailed coverage of correlation and bivariate and multiple regression with emphasis on interpretation and common errors, and discusses the usefulness and limitations of these procedures as tools for prediction and for developing theory.</p> <p>This is one of the few books with coverage sufficient for a 2-semester course sequence in experimental design and statistics as taught in psychology, education, and other behavioral, social, and health sciences.&nbsp; Incorporating the analyses of both experimental and observational data provides continuity of concepts and notation. Prerequisites include courses on basic research methods and statistics. The book is also an excellent resource for practicing researchers.</p></p><p><p><strong>Jerome L Myers</strong> is Professor Emeritus at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.

Paintings, watercolors, and photographs by renowned artists such as Frederic Remington, Georgia O&#x2019;Keeffe, Ansel Adams, Thomas Hart Benton, Dorothea Lange, and Jackson Pollock are considered alongside American Indian ledger drawings, tempuras, and Dineh sandpaintings. Taken together, these works document the quest to create a specifically American art in the decades prior to World War II.<br><i>The Modern West</i> begins with a captivating meditation on the relationship between human culture and the physical landscape by Barry Lopez, who traveled the West in the artists&#x2019; footsteps. Emily Ballew Neff then describes the evolving importance of the West for American artists working out a radically new aesthetic response to space and place, from artist-explorers on the turn-of-the-century frontier, to visionaries of a Californian arcadia, to desert luminaries who found in its stark topography a natural equivalent to abstraction.<br> Beautifully illustrated and handsomely designed, this&nbsp;book is essential to anyone interested in the West and the history of modernism in American art.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Emily Ballew Neff</b>, curator of American Painting and Sculpture at The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, is author of numerous publications, including <i>Frederic Remington</i>. <b>Barry Lopez</b>, a distinguished nature writer and former landscape photographer, is author of the National Book Award&#x2013;winning <i>Arctic Dreams</i> and numerous other works of fiction and nonfiction. <br><br>Modernism, which curator Neff succinctly defines as "a cultural response to modernization and industrialization," was not confined to progress-embracing New York but, rather, was intrinsic to the much-mythologized western expansion. As technology in the form of the rifle, railroad, telegraph, automobile, and industrialized agricultural and mining practices bolstered the war against American Indians and transformed nature, painters and photographers responded to these epic changes in modes ranging from romantic to radical. Barry Lopez sets the historic, moral, and aesthetic markers for this beautifully mind-expanding volume in his opening essay. Neff then launches her gracefully lucid and remarkably informative running commentary, vividly profiling diverse artists and presenting fresh analysis of their interpretations of the grandeur and desolation of the West. Sharpened appreciation for Thomas Moran, Frederic Remington, Ansel Adams, and Georgia O'Keeffe is linked to Neff's broadly illuminating discussions of many others, including Laura Gilpin, who photographed the West for 60 years, and the painters Arthur Wesley Dow, Marsden Hartley, and Alexandre Hogue. Neff's inspired overview creates a new and dynamic perspective on America's land and art. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Filled with facts and figures, this fast-paced history begins with the nerve-wracking test flights of the 1940s and concludes with the F4Us that were active thirty-eight years later. Placed skillfully in between are the stories that gave birth to the legend: the exploits of the aces, including the Medal of Honor recipient who shot down twenty-five enemy planes, and the details of the combat missions of Charles A. Lindbergh. During thirty months of combat in World War II with the U.S. Navy and Marines, the Corsair shot down more than two thousand Japanese planes. In Korea the U-bird, as it was called, was credited with ten aerial victories. <p>A trip down memory lane for anyone who has followed the career of this Cadillac of the props, this new paperback edition of a book first published in hardcover in 1979 offers fine historical aviation reading that presents a riveting picture of the men and machine that helped win two wars.</p></p><p>Barrett Tillman is a widely recognized authority on air warfare in World War II and the author of more than forty nonfiction and fiction books on military topics.

It covers pathology on the upper and lower extremities as well as the whole spine. New treatment strategies are practically and logically presented with recommended exercises and accompanying instructions that can be applied using the vibration platforms. Rationale is given for selected vibration frequencies, amplitudes and modes for the duration and frequency of the exercise session. The manual is grounded in evidence underpinned by a thorough literature review (including a balanced view of both pros and cons) and clinical cases. The authors present clinical treatment parameters that are evidence-based and have supportive physiological rationale that is consistent with the nature of the pathology being treated. The text is further supported by online access to over 35 video clips demonstrating the possible treatment exercises.<ul><li>First book of its kind applying evidence-based vibration technology to physical (physiotherapy) and sport therapy practice </li><li>Exercise recommendations accompanied by over 70 four-colour illustrations </li><li>Indications and contra-indications in clinical practice </li><li>Comprehensive literature review of evidence base and principles </li><li>Written and supported by experts actively applying this technology to their practice </li></ul></p><p><p>"Over the past 5&#x2013;10 years, I have received hundreds of phone calls and e-mails from individuals worldwide who are seeking health care advice on the benefits of WBV for conditions ranging from motor weaknesses to osteoporosis to autism. Unfortunately most health care professionals, like myself, are faced with more questions than answers when it comes to WBV exercise. Thus, these authors have helped to fill this information void by providing the first in-depth analysis and synthesis of the growing body of research on whole body vibration. They have coupled the results of numerous published studies with their own vast experience to provide an overview of the biomechanical and&nbsp;physiological effects of whole body vibration, as well as training guidelines to address a variety of physical impairments and functional goals. Whether your professional background is in sport science or rehabilitation, you will find evidence-based treatment parameters for improving muscle strength and power, soft tissue flexibility, balance and postural stability, bone density, peripheral circulation, and more. In chapters 5 and 6, the authors have also provided an illustrated, stepwise guide to help the novice practitioner utilize this new exercise modality in a safe and effective&nbsp;manner. These authors, and the researchers whose work they have drawn from, have given us an excellent start. Like any initial work, this text is not necessarily an exhaustive review on the subject, but it does provide the scientific basis, clinical rationale, and treatment parameters needed to incorporate WBV into a physical therapy treatment plan or athletic training regimen with a reasonable assurance of success. And, hopefully, the outcomes experienced by these patients and athletes will be documented and added to the burgeoning body of knowledge that is needed for WBV to gain universal acceptance as a standard part of our clinical practice."</p> <p>Martha R.

Joseph McLellan, Washington Post</p><h2>Intelligence Reframed: Multiple Intelligences For The 21st Century</h2><p>Harvard psychologist Howard Gardner has been acclaimed as the most influential educational theorist since John Dewey. His ideas about intelligence and creativity - explicated in such bestselling books as <i>Frames of Mind</i> and <i>Multiple Intelligences</i> (over 200,000 copies in print combined) - have revolutionized our thinking.In his groundbreaking 1983 book <i>Frames of Mind</i> , Howard Gardner first introduced the theory of multiple intelligences, which posits that intelligence is more than a single property of the human mind. That theory has become widely accepted as one of the seminal ideas of the twentieth century and continues to attract attention all over the world.Now in <i>Intelligence Reframed</i> , Gardner provides a much-needed report on the theory, its evolution and revisions. He offers practical guidance on the educational uses of the theory and responds to the critiques leveled against him. He also introduces two new intelligences (existential intelligence and naturalist intelligence) and argues that the concept of intelligence should be broadened, but not so absurdly that it includes every human virtue and value. Ultimately, argues Gardner, possessing a basic set of seven or eight intelligences is not only a unique trademark of the human species, but also perhaps even a working definition of the species. Gardner also offers provocative ideas about creativity, leadership, and moral excellence, and speculates about the relationship between multiple intelligences and the world of work in the future.</p><p>How would a musical genius like Mozart have performed on the SAT or GRE? Well enough to go to an Ivy League? Difficult to say, of course, but thank goodness Howard Gardner thought to ask the question: Can every sort of intelligence be measured with the tools we've been using for the past century and more? In his 1983 book, <i>Frames of Mind</i>, Gardner laid out the foundation for the theory of multiple intelligences (MI). In <i>Intelligence Reframed</i>, a revisitation and elaboration of MI theory, he details the modern history of intelligence and the development of MI, responds to the myths about multiple intelligences, and handles FAQs about the theory and its application. He also restates his ideal educational plan, which would emphasize deep understanding of iconic subjects following from a variety of instructional approaches. (His book <i>The Disciplined Mind</i> discusses this plan in more detail.) Most excitingly, Gardner discusses the possibility for three more intelligences. Of these, he endorses only one, the naturalist intelligence--a person's ability to identify plants and animals in the surrounding environment. He writes, "My recognition that such individuals could not readily be classified in terms of the seven antecedent intelligences led me to consider this additional form of intelligence and to construe the scope of the naturalist's abilities more broadly."<p> An absorbing read from cover to cover, <i>Intelligence Reframed</i> should be studied and discussed by teachers, administrators, policy makers, and all those eager to serve children and prepare them to lead fulfilling lives. <i>--Brian J.

Nearly all of the chapters are authored by a team consisting of a seasoned oncologist and an experienced practitioner who provides direct services in survivorship care. Chapters reflect the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and cover the high-yield pearls and clinical applications that lead to quality patient care outcomes. Part I discusses the basic concepts of survivorship care, models of care, and clinical tools while addressing late and long-term effects of treatment, screening methods for secondary or recurring tumors, and prevention of disease relapse. Part II includes chapters on cancers commonly seen in community practice, such as breast, prostate, lymphoma, and colorectal. Chapters in Part II provide clinical pearls and disease-specific background, a guide to disease surveillance, instructions for monitoring late effects, early detection tips, and information on psychosocial health, all to better direct clinical assessment and management. With cancer survivors an increasing segment of the healthcare population and survivorship care rapidly evolving, it is paramount that oncologists and other care providers are up-to-date on the clinical strategies, interventions, and recommendations for follow-up care. As a pocket-sized, quick reference, <em>Handbook of Cancer Survivorship Care</em> is an indispensable resource for any healthcare provider &#x2013; including physicians, nurses, and other practitioners &#x2013; seeing patients in remission; it covers the must-know points of clinical management and successfully carries over cutting-edge expertise into clinical practice whether it is used at the bedside or in the clinic.</p><p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Includes practical guidance on challenging areas such as addressing psychosocial issues, establishing screening and prevention strategies, managing late effects in cancer survivors and many more</li><li>Easy-to-read outline format makes referencing in the clinical setting quick and convenient</li><li>Practical clinical vignettes with self-assessment Q&amp;A accompany chapters in Part II</li><li>Clinical pearls highlight survivorship guidelines and their application</li><li>Provides management guidelines and detailed disease surveillance strategies for site-specific cancers</li><li>Includes digital access to the e-book</li></ul></p><p></p><h2>The Union Cavalry in the Civil War, Vol. 1: From Fort Sumter to Gettysburg</h2><p><p>In the first comprehensive treatment of the subject, Stephen Z. Starr covers in three volumes the dramatic story of the Union cavalry. In this first volume he presents briefly the story of the United States cavalry prior to the Civil War, describing how the Union cavalry was raised, organized, equipped, and trained, and offering detailed descriptions of the campaigns and battles in which the cavalry engaged -- the Peninsula, Shenandoah Valley/Second Bull Run, Lee's invasion of Maryland, Kelly's Ford, Stoneman's May 1863 Raid, Brandy Station (Fleetwood), Aldie-Middleburg-Upperville, and Gettysburg. Starr focuses on the officers and men of the Union cavalry -- who they were; how they lived, fought, behaved; what they thought. Starr tells their story -- drawn from regimental records and histories, memoirs, letters, diaries, and reminiscences -- whenever possible in the words of the troopers themselves.</p></p><p><p>Stephen Z. Starr, until recently Director of the Cincinnati Historical Society, is the author of Colonel Grenfell's Wars: The Life of a Soldier of Fortune and Jayhawkers: A Civil War Cavalry Regiment and Its Commander.

These techniques are used for a variety of reasons, including the establishment of secure communications, increasing resistance to natural interference, noise and jamming, to prevent detection, and to limit power flux density</p><p></p><h2>L&#39;Argent (BFI Modern Classics)</h2><p>Made when the director was almost 80, Robert Bresson&#39;s &#34;L&#39;Argent&#34; (1983) is a study of murder and motive adapted from Tolstoy. The author compares &#34;L&#39;Argent&#34; to Bresson&#39;s other work and places the film at the crossroads of recent cinema trends - those of the vigilante and serial killer films.</p><p>The career of Robert Bresson (b. 1907) is one of the richest in the history of cinema, but also one of the most enigmatic. For some commentators, Bresson is a severe moralist who&#39;s almost medieval in his concern for the darker aspects of Catholic theology. For others, he&#39;s best seen as a stylist whose work has consistently anticipated cinematic trends. Just as Bresson&#39;s 1959 &#34;Pickpocket &#34;was remodelled by Paul Schrader as &#34;American Gigolo &#34;(1980), so &#34;L&#39;Argent &#34;(1983) is a study of spontaneous murder and a meditation on evil that has a striking kinship with contemporary vigilante and serial killer films. Kent Jones disputes some of the received wisdom about Bresson&#39;s work as it&#39;s epitomized by &#34;L&#39;Argent&#34;: the work can&#39;t simply be reduced to its austere, pessimistic, or religious elements. By exploring the many dimensions of&#34; L&#39;Argent,&#34; Jones finds other elements: beauty, compassion, an overriding concern with the meaningful depiction of experience. &#34;L&#39;Argent &#34;is the culminating work of one of the select group of directors able &#34;to push the cinema, through the force of their own genius, onto a new plain.&#34;<b>Kent Jones</b> has written widely on the cinema, notably for <i>Film Comment. </i>He has been a guest programmer and jury-member for film festivals around the world, and is programer at The Film Society of Lincoln Center in New York City.</p><h2>Maiolica Ol�: Spanish and Mexican Decorative Traditions Featuring the Collection of the Museum of International Folk Art</h2><p><p>Featuring the fine collection of seventeenth- to nineteenth-century Spanish and Mexican maiolica at the Museum of International Folk Art in Santa Fe, this book explores and celebrates Spanish traditional ceramics of Old and New Spain. Renowned ceramic expert Florence C. Lister and archaeologist Robert H. Lister studies 144 examples of historical maiolica in what is the first study of its kind tracing the decorative styles, influences, and innovations in a ceramic tradition that is almost a millennium old.</p></p><p><p>For four decades <strong>Florence C. Lister</strong> has been involved with ceramic studies throughout the Southwest and the Spanish world. Her late husband, <strong>Robert H. Lister</strong>, was a renowned archaeologist. Together the two coauthored many books including <em>Sixteenth-Century Maiolica Pottery in the Valley of Mexico</em> and <em>Andalusian Ceramics in Spain and New Spain: A Cultural Register from the Third Century B.C. to 1700</em>.</p><p>Majolica pottery is characterized by an opaque tin-oxide glaze that conceals the color of the clay underneath. The Listers, experts who have studied pottery for over 30 years, here present a scholarly work tracing the evolution of this type of pottery from its origins in Spain to its colonial development in Mexico. To illustrate their findings, they draw on the majolica collection of the Museum of International Folk Art located in Santa Fe, NM. The result is both a study of this distinctive art form and a lovely display of its best examples that any art lover should enjoy underlining the pottery's significant place in the history of decorative arts.

Landes and Posner propose that tort law is best understood as a system for achieving an efficient allocation of resources to safety--that, on the whole, rules and doctrines of tort law encourage the optimal investment in safety by potential injurers and potential victims. </p><p> The book contains both a comprehensive description of the major doctrines of tort law and a series of formal economic models used to explore the economic properties of these doctrines. All the formal models are translated into simple commonsense terms so that the "math less" reader can follow the text without difficulty; legal jargon is also avoided, for the sake of economists and other readers not trained in the law. </p><p> Although the primary focus is on explaining existing doctrines rather than on exploring their implementation by juries, insurance adjusters, and other "real world" actors, the book has obvious pertinence to the ongoing controversies over damage awards, insurance rates and availability, and reform of tort law-in fact it is an essential prerequisite to sound reform. Among other timely topics, the authors discuss punitive damage awards in products liability cases, the evolution of products liability law, and the problem of liability for "mass disaster" torts, such as might be produced by a nuclear accident. More generally, this book is an important contribution to the "law and economics" movement, the most exciting and controversial development in modern legal education and scholarship, and will become an obligatory reference for all who are concerned with the study of tort law. </p></p><p><b>William M. Landes</b> is Clifton R.

Meticulously researched and well written, The Rescue ties these elements together into an epic that is emotionally engaging from start to rousing finish."--Martin Russ, author of Breakout and The Last Parallel<br><br>"Smith's thoroughly researched, detailed account of the brave American and Filipino guerrillas on Negros Island in the Philippines will do much to introduce readers to this little-known aspect of World War II in the Pacific. Operating in the most primitive conditions, suffering the deprivations of living and fighting in the wild, these guerrillas were a formidable army and did much to win the war for the Allies in World War II. And the courageous and resourceful submariners of the USS Crevalle of the Pacific Fleet went well beyond the call of duty to rescue their fellow Americans from harm's way. This is a fascinating story well told." --Elizabeth Norman, author of the award-winning We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese<br><br> "The Rescue is a delightful journey with the gallant few who resisted the Japanese occupation of the Philippines and who shaped the larger events which led to victory in the Pacific.

A must-read for all those interested in one of the great secret submarine operations of World War II and all action adventure fans alike!"--Richard P. Henrick, author of Crimson Tide and Nightwatch</p><p>By 1944, forty Americans?missionaries, escaped POWs, and sugar planters?had endured nearly three years of hell while hiding from the Japanese in the mountains of the central Philippines. They had moved frequently from one primitive hideout to the next, always in danger, subsisting on what little the locals could spare. They had seen friends and family captured, even murdered. And their faith in God, their country, and themselves had been stretched to the breaking point.<p>Then word came that MacArthur was sending a submarine, the Crevalle, to save them. The refugees confronted what they hoped would be their final trial: a hundred-mile trek south to meet the sub, a trek that would take them through dense jungle and trackless swamps with the Japanese an ever-present threat and the knowledge that one false step could result in tragedy.</p><p>But the refugees had no idea their dramatic rescue was just a cover for a mission of great strategic importance.</p><p>As MacArthur and Nimitz pushed the Japanese back, island by island, they put to flight Admiral Koga Mineichi, Yamamoto?s successor and the commander of Japan?s powerful Combined Fleet. Koga carried with him the detailed plans for the imperial navy?s long-planned "decisive battle" at sea. But his plane crashed and the plans washed up on a Philippine beach. Thanks to the courage of two fishermen, the secret papers soon found their way to an extraordinary American guerrilla leader, who then risked everything to get them to the rendezvous with the Crevalle.</p><p>But would the Crevalle reach the plans and the refugees before the Japanese caught wind of the scheme? The Crevalle and her heroic crew would first have to sail through enemy-infested waters to reach the island. And even if they made it, would the sub successfully pick up its precious cargo, then survive the 1,500-mile journey to Australia and freedom?</p><p>A cross between the bestselling Blind Man?s Bluff and the award-winning We Band of Angels, Steven Trent Smith?s The Rescue is an unforgettable account of this daring mission, a relentless personal drama, and a masterpiece of military history.</p>STEVEN TRENT SMITH is a five-time Emmy Award&#x2014;winning freelance TV photojournalist with a passion for history.

He went to college at Berkeley for a year, ran a record store and had his own classical-music show on a local radio station. He published his first short story, &#39;Beyond Lies the Wub&#39; in 1952. Among his many fine novels are The Man in the High Castle, Time Out of Joint, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said.Chapter 1<br>At sunset, acrid-smelling air from the lake puffed along the empty streets of Montario, Idaho. With the air appeared clouds of sharp-winged yellow flies; they smashed against the windshields of cars in motion. The drivers strove to clear them away with their wipers. As the street lights lit up Hill Street, stores began to close until only the drugstores&#x2014;one at each end of town&#x2014;remained open. The Luxor movie theater did not open until six-thirty. The several cafes did not count as parts of the town; open or shut, they belonged to the highway, US 95, which made use of Hill Street.<br>Hooting and clacking and sliding along the northernmost of fourteen parallel tracks, the Union Pacific sleeper appeared, passing from Portland to Boise. It did not stop, but at the Hill Street crossing it slowed until the mail car appeared to be a dingy-green metal building among the brick warehouses along the track, scarcely in motion, with its doors open and two trainmen in striped suits hanging out with their hands dangling down. A middle-aged woman, wrapped up in quilted wool to keep warm, stepped forward at the sidewalk and deftly handed several letters up to one of the trainmen.<br>The wig-wag signal bonged and the red light flashed for a considerable period after the last car of the train had gone off out of sight.<br>At the lunch counter in his drugstore, Mr. Hagopian ate a small fried hamburger steak and canned string beans while he read a copy of Confidential taken from the rack by the front door. Now, at six, no customers bothered him. He sat so that he could see the street outside. If anyone came along he intended to stop eating and wipe his mouth and hands with a paper napkin.<br>Far off, running and whirling about to run backwards with his head up, came a boy wearing a Davy Crockett cap with tail. The boy circled his way across the street, and Mr. Hagopian realized that he was coming into the drugstore.<br>The boy, hands in his pockets, his motions stiff and jerky, stepped into the store and to the candy bars all intermingled under the sign, 3 for 25�. Mr. Hagopian continued eating and reading. The boy at last picked out a box of Milk Duds, a package of M &amp; M chocolates, and a Hershey bar.<br>&#x201c;Fred,&#x201d; Mr. Hagopian called.<br>His son Fred pushed the curtains aside, from the back room, and came out to wait on the boy.<br>At seven o&#x2019;clock Mr. Hagopian said to his son Fred, &#x201c;You might as well go on home. There won&#x2019;t be enough more tonight to make it worth both our time.&#x201d; He felt irritable, thinking about it. &#x201c;Nobody of consequence is going to show up and buy anything the rest of tonight.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll stick around awhile longer,&#x201d; Fred said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have anything to do anyhow.&#x201d;<br>The telephone rang. It was Mrs. de Rouge, on Pine Street, wanting a prescription filled and delivered. Mr. Hagopian got out the book, and when he looked up the number he found that it was for Mrs. de Rouge&#x2019;s pain pills. So he told her that Fred would bring them by eight o&#x2019;clock.<br>While he was making up the pills&#x2014;capsules of codeine&#x2014;the door of the drugstore opened and a young man, well-dressed in a single-breasted suit and tie, stepped in. He had a sandy, bony nose and short-cropped hair; by that, Mr. Hagopian recognized him, and also by his smile. He had good, strong white teeth.<br>&#x201c;Can I help you, sir?&#x201d; Fred said.<br>&#x201c;Just looking right now,&#x201d; the man said. Hands in his pockets he moved over to the magazine racks.<br>I wonder why he hasn&#x2019;t been in here for a while, Mr. Hagopian thought to himself. He used to come in here all the time. Since he was a kid. Has he been taking his business up to Wickley&#x2019;s? At that, the old man felt growing indignation. He finished up Mrs. de Rouge&#x2019;s pills, dropped them into a bottle, and walked to the counter.<br>The young man, Skip Stevens, had brought a copy of Life up to Fred, and was rummaging in his trouser pocket for change.<br>&#x201c;Anything else, sir?&#x201d; Fred said.<br>Mr. Hagopian started to speak to Skip Stevens, but at that moment Skip leaned toward Fred and said in a low voice, &#x201c;Yes, I wanted to pick up a package of Trojans.&#x201d; So Mr. Hagopian delicately turned away and busied himself until Fred had wrapped the package of contraceptives and rung up the sale on the register.<br>&#x201c;Thank you, sir,&#x201d; Fred said, in the business-like tone he always took when somebody bought contraceptives. As he left the counter he winked at his father.<br>His magazine under his arm, Skip started toward the door, very slowly, eyeing the magazines and shelves to show that he did not feel intimidated. Mr. Hagopian caught up with him and said, &#x201c;Long time no see.&#x201d; His indignation made his voice rattle. &#x201c;I hope you and your family have been well.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Everybody&#x2019;s fine,&#x201d; Skip said. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t seen them for a couple of months. I&#x2019;m living down in Reno. I have a job there.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; Mr. Hagopian said, not believing him. &#x201c;I see.&#x201d;<br>Fred tilted his head, listening.<br>&#x201c;You remember Skip Stevens,&#x201d; Mr. Hagopian said to his son.<br>&#x201c;Oh yeah,&#x201d; Fred said. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t recognize you.&#x201d; He nodded at Skip. &#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t seen you in months.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m located down in Reno now,&#x201d; Skip explained. &#x201c;This is the first time I&#x2019;ve been up here to Montario since April.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I wondered why we hadn&#x2019;t seen you,&#x201d; Fred said.<br>Mr. Hagopian asked Skip, &#x201c;Your brother still off back east at school?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Skip said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s out of school now, and married.&#x201d;<br>This boy isn&#x2019;t living down in Reno, Mr. Hagopian thought. He&#x2019;s just ashamed to admit why he hasn&#x2019;t been in. Skip shifted about from one foot to the other, obviously ill-at-ease. He obviously wanted to leave.<br>&#x201c;What line of work are you in?&#x201d; Fred said.<br>Skip said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a buyer.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What kind of buyer?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;For C.B.B.,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;Television?&#x201d; Mr. Hagopian said.<br>&#x201c;For Consumers&#x2019; Buying Bureau,&#x201d; Skip said.<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br>Skip said, &#x201c;Something like a department store. It&#x2019;s a new place down on Highway 40, between Reno and Sparks.&#x201d;<br>With a strange look on his face, Fred said, &#x201c;I know what that is. Some guy was up here telling me about it.&#x201d; To his father, he said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s one of those discount houses.&#x201d;<br>At first, the old man did not understand. And then he remembered what he had heard about discount houses. &#x201c;Do you want to drive the retailers out of business?&#x201d; he said loudly to Skip.<br>Skip, turning red, said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s no different from a supermarket. It buys in volume and passes the savings on to the consumer. That&#x2019;s how Henry Ford operated, producing in volume.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not the American way,&#x201d; Mr. Hagopian said.<br>&#x201c;Sure it is,&#x201d; Skip said. &#x201c;It means a higher standard of living because it eliminates overhead and the middleman&#x2019;s costs.&#x201d;<br>Mr. Hagopian returned to the counter. To his son he said, &#x201c;Mrs. de Rouge wants some more pain pills.&#x201d; He held out the bottl</p><h2>Notre-Dame de Paris (French Edition)</h2><p>This is a reproduction of a book published before 1923.

Renduel, 1836<br><br> Literary Criticism; European; French; Literary Criticism / European / French</p><p>The best-known of the French Romantic writers, Victor Hugo was a poet, novelist, dramatist, and political critic. Hugo was an avid supporter of French republicanism and advocate for social and political equality, themes that reflect most strongly in his works Les Mis?rables, Notre-Dame de Paris (The Hunchback of Notre-Dame), and Le Dernier jour d&#39;un condamn? (The Last Day of a Condemned Man). Hugo&#39;s literary works were successful from the outset, earning him a pension from Louis XVIII and membership in the prestigious Acad?mie fran?aise, and influencing the work of literary figures such as Albert Camus, Charles Dickens, and Fyodor Dostoevsky. Elevated to the peerage by King Louis-Philippe, Hugo played an active role in French politics through the 1848 Revolution and into the Second and Third Republics. Hugo died in 1885, revered not only for his influence on French literature, but also for his role in shaping French democracy. He is buried in the Panth?on alongside Alexandre Dumas and ?mile Zola.</p><h2>Morgan Grenfell 1838-1988: The Biography of a Merchant Bank</h2><p>This is the arresting 150-year story of one of the oldest and most illustrious merchant banks, and of the men, George Peabody and J.P. Morgan, who built it. The book chronicles Morgan Grenfell's role in financing British oversea purchases during World War I, in taking the lead among the private London bankers in reconstructing Europe during the 1920s, and in pioneering the new field of corporate finance. By the 1980s, Morgan Grenfell was the most powerful and feared corporate finance house in London, but as a consequence of the October 1987 stock market crash, Morgan Grenfell withdrew from the securities business to concentrate on areas of traditional strength. Based on a wide range of original sources, this book is unmatched as a banking history: no other author has combined unrestricted access to the bank's archives with a narrative of events up to the 1980s.<br></p><p>Kathleen Burk is Lecturer in Modern History and Politics at Imperial College, LondonThis authorized sesquicentennial history of the British merchant bank Morgan Grenfell superbly demonstrates the influence that lending institutions had on the history of Europe and the United States. Started as a modest London counting house by an American named George Peabody, the firm gained stature due to the efforts of its first partner, J.P. Morgan. Accommodating the need for capital arising from industrial development and from European conflicts, the firm prospered. As the 20th century progressed, attention focused on the New York correspondent bank, J.P. Morgan, and Morgan Grenfell's influence declined after the 1970s. This carefully written book belongs in business libraries.

These provocative ideas gave rise to cultural and political innovations that were exported and adopted worldwide. Wherever there was discontent with modern existence or traditional societies were undergoing transformation, anti-Western sentiments arose. Many people perceived the Russian soul as the antithesis of the capitalist, imperialist West and turned to Russian ideas for inspiration and even salvation.</p><br><p> Steven Marks shows that in this turbulent atmosphere of the past century and a half, Russia's lines of influence were many and reached far. Russia gave the world new ways of writing novels. It launched cutting-edge trends in ballet, theater, and art that revolutionized contemporary cultural life. The Russian anarchist movement benignly shaped the rise of vegetarianism and environmentalism while also giving birth to the violent methods of modern terrorist organizations. Tolstoy's visions of nonviolent resistance inspired Gandhi and the U.S. Civil Rights movement at the same time that Russian anti-Semitic conspiracy theories intoxicated right-wing extremists the world over. And dictators from Mussolini and Hitler to Mao and Saddam Hussein learned from the experiments of the Soviet regime.</p><br><p> Moving gracefully from Moscow and St. Petersburg to Beijing and Berlin, London and Luanda, Mexico and Mississippi, Marks takes us on an intellectual tour of the Russian exports that shaped the twentieth century. The result is a richly textured and stunningly original account of the extent to which Russia--as an idea and a producer of ideas--has contributed to the making of the modern world. Placing Russia in its global context, the book betters our understanding of the anti-Western strivings that have been such a prominent feature of recent history.</p></p><p><p>"Deep, perceptive, and thought provoking, this is a work of breathtaking sweep and imagination, massive learning, and unflagging interest. It is also beautifully written--flowing and full of intellectual excitement."<b>--Richard Stites, Georgetown University</b></p><p>"This is an astonishingly broad and ambitious project, one that at first seems impossible but then slowly grows on the reader--in plausibility, synthesizing intelligence, and explanatory power. Marks seems to know the contours of everything relating to Russian ideas, their politics as well as their expression through literature, visual art, dance, theater, both in domestic contexts and around the world. His thesis will cause a stir. But Russian culture has rarely appeared as monumentally integrated and influential as within the pages of this book."<b>--Caryl Emerson, Princeton University</b></p><b>Steven G.

From the late Jeanne S. Chall, Professor of Education at Harvard University and a leading figure in American education, the book reviews and evaluates the many educational reforms and innovations that have been proposed and employed over the past century. Systematically analyzing a vast body of qualitative and quantitative research, Chall compares achievement rates that result from traditional, teacher-centered approaches with those resulting from progressive, student-centered methods. Her findings are striking and clear: that teacher-centered approaches result in higher achievement overall, with particular benefits for children of lower socioeconomic status and those with learning difficulties. Offering cogent recommendations for practice, the book makes a strong case for basing future education reforms and innovations on a solid empirical foundation. In a new foreword to the paperback edition, Marilyn Jager Adams reflects on Chall's deep-rooted commitment to and enduring legacy in educating America's children. <br></p><p>&#34;The capstone work of a great scholar, this book synthesizes all the relevant research to show that student-centered teaching does not live up to its education-school billing. Rather, it is teacher-centered education which leads to greater excellence and fairness. For the sake of our children, we must not wait decades, as we did with reading, before heeding the truths uncovered by the matchless scholarship of Jeanne Chall.&#34; E.D. Hirsch, Jr, Ph.D., University Professor of Education and Humanities, University of VirginiaJeanne S. Chall, PhD, was Emeritus Professor of Education at Harvard University Graduate School of Education until her death in 1999. She founded and directed the Harvard Reading Laboratory. Her books include Learning to Read: The Great Debate, Stages of Reading Development, Readability Revisited and the New Dale-Chall Readability Formula, and Qualitative Assessment of Text Difficulty. A member of the National Academy of Education and the Reading Hall of Fame, Dr. Chall served on the Board of Directors of the International Reading Association and the National Society for the Study of Education.

A man has been beaten to death in his own home. A man who just happened to be Commander Alastair Gilbert of the Metropolitan Police...Only adding to Kincaid&#39;s problems are his tangled personal feelings for Sergeant Gemma James. And in an investigation of this importance neither can afford a breakdown in their relationship. Combining subtle emotional nuances and psychological insights with the intricacies of police procedure, Deborah Crombie produces a powerful contemporary mystery in the classic tradition.</p><p>The three things that make Deborah Crombie's books about a pair of Scotland Yard detectives so fascinating are (a) the way the relationship between Superintendent Duncan Kinkaid and Sgt. Gemma James is constantly--and believably--changing; (b) the meticulously researched and impeccably presented details of British police procedure; and (c) the fact that the superb chronicler behind these multi-layered tales of British society is a native Texan and current resident of a small town near Dallas. This fourth entry in Crombie's excellent series sends the gently raised, intellectual Kinkaid and the tougher, more abrasive James out after the killer of a much-unloved senior policeman in suburban Surrey. Other books in the series also available in paperback are <i>All Shall Be Well</i>, <i>Leave the Grave Green</i>, and <i>A Share in Death</i>.When a high-ranking police officer is brutally murdered, Scotland Yard Superintendent Duncan Kincaid and Sergeant Gemma James are drawn into a case that not only challenges their investigative skills but forces them to examine their ethics and their relationship with each other. On an evening in mid-November, Alastair Gilbert, a Commander in the London Metropolitan Police, is found dead in the kitchen of his suburban Surrey home by his wife, Claire, and seventeen-year-old stepdaughter, Lucy. Gilbert was bludgeoned to death, and there was no sign of forced entry. Someone must have taken Gilbert by surprise - or the killer was someone he trusted. Kincaid was once Gilbert&#39;s student at the police academy, and he fears his personal antipathy toward the dead man may lessen his objectivity in the case. Even more distracting is the state of his relationship with Gemma - strained and tense ever since their intimate encounter a few days earlier. Both Duncan and Gemma must try to put their feelings for each other and their memories of Alastair Gilbert aside as they discover that Gilbert did not always play by the rules that he publicly espoused, particularly when the rules might have hindered his rise to power.</p><h2>More Than a Carpenter</h2><p>With almost ten million copies in print, <i>More Than a Carpenter</i> continues to be the most powerful evangelism tool worldwide.

Author and renowned speaker Josh McDowell acknowledges that while the topic of God is widely accepted, the name of Jesus often causes irritation. "Why don't the names of Buddha, Mohammed, Confucius offend people? The reason is that these others didn't claim to be God, but Jesus did." By addressing questions about scientific and historical evidence, the validity of the Bible, and proofs of the resurrection, McDowell helps the reader come to an informed and intelligent decision about whether Jesus was a liar, a lunatic, or the Lord. This short, 128-page gem does not employ fancy theological words, forsaking the layman, but reads more like an intimate research document laying out the facts with veracious accuracy, from reliable sources ranging from secular scientists to conservative seminarians. A skeptic himself for many years, McDowell always believed that Christians were "out of their minds" but now insists that "never has an individual been called upon to commit intellectual suicide in trusting Christ as Savior and Lord." McDowell adeptly articulates fundamental answers to poignant questions that cause the skeptic to consider whether Jesus was a liar causing countless martyrs to die in his wake, a lunatic deserving death, or actually the Lord of the universe. <i>--Jill Heatherly</i>The story that could change your life. Skeptic Josh McDowell thought Christians were out of their minds. He ridiculed and insulted them, then decided to combat them with his own thorough research to disprove the claims of Jesus Christ. To his surprise, he discovered that the evidence suggested exactly the opposite-that Jesus, instead of being simply a first-century Hebrew carpenter, truly was the God he claimed to be. Since its original publication, More Than a Carpenter has sold over 20 million copies and changed countless lives. Now, in this revised and updated edition, Josh is joined by his son, Sean, as they tackle the questions that today&#39;s generation continues to ask: &#34;Can I be spiritual without believing in God?&#34; &#34;How can I make sure that my life counts for something?&#34; &#34;Is it really possible to know anything for sure about God or Jesus?&#34; Read the story. Weigh the facts. Experience his love. And then watch what happens.</p><h2>Western Civilization: Beyond Boundaries</h2><p>WESTERN CIVILIZATION, Sixth Edition, is distinguished for its wider definition of Europe that includes Eastern Europe, Scandinavia, and European frontiers.

Seldom is this more clearly brought to light than in encounters between people from different cultural backgrounds, when dissimilar communication practices may lead to frustration and misunderstanding. This thought-provoking text presents a new framework for understanding the impact of culture on communication and for helping students build intercultural communication competence. With illustrative examples from around the globe, the book shows that verbal and nonverbal communication involves much more than transmitting a particular message--it also reflects each participant's self-image, group identifications and values, and privacy and relational needs. Readers learn to move effectively and appropriately through a wide range of transcultural situations by combining culture-specific knowledge with mindful listening and communication skills. Throughout, helpful tables and charts and easy-to-follow guidelines for putting concepts into practice enhance the book's utility for students. <br></p><p>Stella Ting-Toomey, PhD, is Professor of Speech Communication at California State University, Fullerton.

Dubliners, about Joyce&#39;s native city, is faithful to his country, seeing it unflinchingly and challenging every precedent and piety in Irish literature. The stories in Dubliners show us truants, seducers, hostesses, corrupt politicians, failing priests, struggling musicians, poets, patriots, and many more simply striving to get by. A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man falls between the realism of Dubliners and the symbolism of Ulysses. The novel is a highly autobiographical account of the youth of Stephen Dedalus, who comes to realize that before he can become a true artist, he must rid himself of the stultifying effects of the religion, politics and essential bigotry of his life in late 19th century Ireland. Written with a light touch, it is perhaps the most accessible of Joyce&#39;s works. Ulysses is James Joyce&#39;s astonishing masterpiece. Scandalously frank, it tells of the events which befall Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus in Dublin on 16 June 1904, during which Bloom&#39;s voluptuous wife, Molly, commits adultery. Initially deemed obscene in England and the USA, this richly-allusive novel, revolutionary in its modernistic experimentalism, was hailed as a work of genius by W. B. Yeats, T. S. Eliot and Ernest Hemingway. Finnegans Wake is the book of Here Comes Everybody and Anna Livia Plurabelle and their family - their book, but in a curious way the book of us all as well as all our books. Joyce&#39;s last great work, it is not comprised of many borrowed styles, like Ulysses, but, rather, formulated as one dense, tongue-twisting soundscape. It also remains the most hilarious, &#39;obscene&#39;, book of innuendos ever to be imagined.</p><p></p><h2>The Most Venerable Book (Shang Shu)</h2><p>A wonderfully enjoyable storehouse of ancient Chinese history and legends, which also has an important role in understanding 21st-century China &#39;And remember: Heaven&#39;s blessing will cease forever if there&#39;s despair and poverty in your lands&#39; The Most Venerable Book (also known as The Book of History) is one of the Five Classics, a key work of Chinese literature which preserves some of the most ancient and dramatic chronicles of the history, both real and mythological, of the Chinese state. For many centuries it was a central work for anyone wishing to work for the Imperial administration, preserving as it does a fascinating mixture of key Confucian concepts as well as page after page of heroes, benevolent rulers, sagacious ministers, and struggles against flood, corruption and vicious, despotic rulers. The First Emperor tried in 213 BC to have all copies of the book destroyed because of its subversive implication that &#39;the Mandate of Heaven&#39; could be withdrawn from rulers who failed their people. For similar reasons it was also banned by Chairman Mao. Extraordinarily, the values of The Most Venerable Book have been revived by the Chinese government of the 2010s.</p><p>Martin Palmer is Director of the International Consultancy on Religion, Education and Culture (ICOREC) and Secretary General of the Alliance of Religions and Conservation (ARC). His previous translations include The Book of Chuang Tzu and The Most Venerable Book (both Penguin Classics), The Dao de Jing and The I Ching.The text is alive with the deeds and misdeeds of Chinese rulers, some told in graphic and gory detail . . . Palmer&#39;s introduction is witty and eschews any sign of academic-speak . . . There has been a revival in interest in China in Confucian ethics in recent years as people search for moral points of reference . . .

The tragic events of ""Bloody Sunday"" usher in a sequence of massive and paralyzing national strikes that eventually force the tsar to turn his government into a constitutional monarchy, and it appears that the radical element has finally won. But for Anna Fedorcenko, the overwhelming tragedy of that fateful day was the slaying of her beloved husband, Sergei. While her loss is a painful struggle, it is Sergei&#x2019;s sons who are most dramatically affected by their father&#x2019;s untimely death. Andrei, the youngest, becomes driven to see his father&#x2019;s death avenged, and thus his boundless energies are aimed toward the downfall of the monarchy. Yuri, the oldest, is also grief-stricken, but he approaches it with characteristic confusion and uncertainty and finds he cannot support his brother&#x2019;s revolutionary fervor. As Russia plunges from World War I into the ensuing civil war between the Bolsheviks and an army of White Russians comprised of nobility and others opposed to Lenin, the family of Anna Fedorcenko is caught in the middle of conflicting national interests. Will their faith and love be strong enough to help them survive?</p><p><b>The Tragedy of Bloody Sunday Left Its Stain Upon the Nation, and Nobody will Go Untested by These Turbulent Times.<br></b><br>The year 1905 is drawing to an end, and great changes are sweeping through Russia.

Its colourful, exotic and remote imagery greatly appealed to the Victorian age&#39;s fascination with the Orient, while its luxurious sensual warmth acted as a striking counterpoint to the growth of scientific determinism, industrialisation and the soulless Darwinian doctrine of the survival of the fittest.

Printed on heavy, cream-colored paper stock, the edges of the pages have been left rough, simulating the way in which the story might have appeared in Dickens's own time.

In this astutely argued book, Gerard N. Magliocca explores how Bryan's effort to reach the White House energized conservatives across the nation and caused a transformation in constitutional law. </p><p>Responding negatively to the Populist agenda, the Supreme Court established a host of new constitutional principles during the 1890s. Many of them proved long-lasting and highly consequential, including the "separate but equal" doctrine supporting racial segregation, the authorization of the use of force against striking workers, and the creation of the liberty of contract. The judicial backlash of the 1890s&#x2014;the most powerful the United States has ever experienced&#x2014;illustrates vividly the risks of seeking fundamental social change. Magliocca concludes by examining the lessons of the Populist experience for advocates of change in our own divisive times.</p></p><p><b>Gerard N. Magliocca</b> is Samuel R. Rosen Professor of Law, Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law, Indianapolis.&#34;&#39;Magliocca has written an excellent constitutional history of a pivotal period in American law...

Voegelin critiques in these texts a "modernity without restraint." It is a modernity with Hegelian, Marxian, Nietzschean, Heideggerian, positivist, Fascist, and other predominantly German characteristics. The author confronts this modernity with Western meaning as it emerged in ancient Greece, Rome, Israel, and Christianity and became transformed in the European Middle Ages, the Italian Renaissance, and the Anglo- American political formation.</p><p>This three-in-one volume delves into the intellectual and spiritual complications of modernity, tracing its evolution from the ancient civilizations to the twentieth century. In his substantial new introduction, Manfred Henningsen explores the experiential background that motivated Voegelin's theoretical analyses and the new relevance that his work has gained in recent years with the unexpected collapse of state socialism in East Germany, Eastern Europe, and the Soviet Union. <i>Modernity without Restraint</i> will be a valuable addition to intellectual history and Voegelin studies.</p></p><p>About the Author<p>Eric Voegelin (1901-1985) was one of the most original and influential philosophers of our time.

In 1938, he and his wife, fleeing Hitler, emigrated to the United States. They became American citizens in 1944. Voegelin spent much of his career at Louisiana State University, the University of Munich, and the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.

These influential strategy ideas have lured many companies into a dangerous internal focus, viewing the world from the inside out. As a result, companies lose sight of the market, which leads to poor results over the long run. Inside-out thinking distracts companies from the core purpose of a business: to create and serve customers. </p><p>Fulfilling that purpose can be done only by approaching strategy from the outside in. In this refreshing look at creating enduring business value, two business school professors from The Wharton School and The Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, challenge you to shift your perspective. They demonstrate that companies that adopt--and fight to keep--an outside-in view focused on customer value have grown revenue, profit, and shareholder value through both boom and bust business cycles. </p><p>Applying years of research, George S. Day and Christine Moorman illustrate that an outside-in view requires constant vigilance and focus on four customer value imperatives:</p><ul> <li>Be a customer value leader </li><li>Innovate new value for customers </li><li>Capitalize on the customer as an asset </li><li>Capitalize on the brand as an asset</li></ul> <p>Only companies that operate with an outside-in view from the C-suite to the front lines can expect to maximize and profit from customer value. </p><p><i>Strategy from the Outside In</i> puts you ahead of the competition and, just as important, keeps you there. <br><br> Visit www.strategyfromtheoutsidein.com <br> </p><p><b>Praise for <i>Strategy from the Outside In</i></b></p> <p>"Throughout P&amp;G's long history, we have focused on the four customer value imperatives outlined in this excellent book&#x2015;and are as committed to them today as ever.

Or that the common pretzel was once a Lenten reward for the pious?<i> Why Do Catholics Eat Fish on Friday</i> is a fascinating guide to the roots of all-things-Catholic.

Foley</b> is the author of <i>Wedding Rites: The Complete Guide to Traditional Weddings.</i> He is a professor at Baylor University.</p>Part apologetics and part history, this book digs into the Catholic roots of contemporary culture. Foley, who holds a doctorate in Catholic theology and is a professor at Baylor University, researched extensively for this project. It is not a collection of trivia, but rather a compendium of etymologies and concise historical facts about the Catholic foundations of architecture, music, literature, science and recreation. The breadth of material is impressive and includes topics as varied as the creation of the pretzel, the origin of modern opera, the foundation of modern genetics and the development of sign language. As Foley argues in his introduction, this diversity should not be a surprise, for "there is something intrinsic to Catholicism that lends to it a vibrant dynamism." Foley's work highlights that, at its best, Catholicism affirms the beauty of the world and encourages searching for the holy in daily life. Foley's language can be preachy and catechetical; these passages are the weakest in the text. But when he focuses on the history, Foley's collection of theological facts makes for a fascinating and informative read. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This is a drama of blackmail, disinheritance and romance set in Ireland.</p><p>Anthony Trollope (1815-1882) started his writing career while working in Ireland as a postal surveyor. Travelling around the country, Trollope gained knowledge of the country and its people which proved to be useful material for his first two novels, The Macdermots of Ballycloran (1847) and The Kellys and the O&#39;Kellys (1848). Trollope soon started writing fiercely, producing a series entitled Chronicles of Barsetshire. The Warden, the first in the series, was published in 1855. Barchester Towers (1857), the comic masterpiece, Doctor Thorne (1858), Framley Parsonage (1861), The Small House at Allington (1864) and The Last Chronicle of Barset (1867) followed, portraying events in an imaginary English county of Barsetshire. In 1867, Trollope left the Post Office to run as a candidate for the Parliament. Having lost at the elections, Trollope focused on his writing. A satire from his later writing, The Way We Live Now (1875) is often viewed as Trollope&#39;s major work, however, his popularity and writing reputation diminished at the later stage of his life. Anthony Trollope died in London in 1882.</p><h2>Easy Grammar 4 And 5 - Teacher Edition: Grades 4 And 5</h2><p>Contains both the student and teacher pages.</p><p></p><h2>Rhapsodies in Black: Art of the Harlem Renaissance</h2><p>Harlem has captivated the imagination of writers, artists, intellectuals, and politicians around the world since the early decades of this century. <i>Rhapsodies in Black: Art of the Harlem Renaissance</i> examines the cultural reawakening of Harlem in the 1920s and 1930s as a key moment in twentieth-century art history, one that transcended regional and racial boundaries. Published to coincide with the exhibition that opens in England and travels to the United States, this catalog reflects the Harlem Renaissance's impressive range of art forms&#x2014;literature, music, dance, theater, painting, sculpture, photography, film, and graphic design. The participants included not only artists based in New York, but also those from other parts of the United States, the Caribbean, and Europe.<br><br>Richard J. Powell and David A. Bailey present selected works that focus on six themes: Representing "The New Negro;" Another Modernism; Blues, Jazz, and the Performative Paradigm; The Cult of the Primitive; Africa: Inheritance and Seizure; and Jacob Lawrence's Toussaint L'Ouverture series. The visual arts from 1919 to 1938 included in the book suggest the extraordinary vibrancy of the time when Harlem was a metaphor for modernity. In spite of the importance of the Harlem Renaissance to early twentieth-century American culture and to the artistic climate of "Jazz Age" Paris and Weimar Berlin, few art exhibitions have been devoted exclusively to the subject. <i>Rhapsodies in Black</i> will be welcomed for its unique presentation of this creative time.</p><p><b>Richard J. Powell</b> is Professor and Chair of Art History at Duke University. <b>David A. Bailey</b> is Director of the African and Asian Artists' Archive, University of East London.A handsomely illustrated and provocative investigation of the accomplishments of black American artists, including actors, singers, painters, photographers, and sculptors, during the 1920s and '30s. While the book is meant to accompany an exhibit that has opened in London and will travel to the US, Powell (Art History/Duke Univ.) and Bailey (director of the African and Asian Artists' Archive/Univ. of East London) have produced something more than a catalog: The essays collected here are ambitious and decidedly controversial, and favor very focused inquiries (on black theater, on Josephine Baker's impact on the black image in white media, and on Paul Robeson's struggles to define what it meant to be a black artist) rather than chronological summaries. Those looking for an overview of the Harlem Renaissance will not find it here. But the reader will find some interesting ruminations on the origins and nature of a distinctly African-American art and some stunning work, including vibrant street scenes by Archibald Motley and Edward Burra, a portfolio of crisp, vibrant photographs of Harlem by James VanDerZee, and the vigorous, folk-influenced paintings of Jacob Lawrence.

Vol. 1</h2><p>Andr� Bazin's <i>What Is Cinema?</i> (volumes I and II) have been classics of film studies for as long as they've been available and are considered the gold standard in the field of film criticism. Although Bazin made no films, his name has been one of the most important in French cinema since World War II. He was co-founder of the influential <i>Cahiers du Cin�ma, </i>which under his leadership became one of the world's most distinguished publications. Championing the films of Jean Renoir (who contributed a short foreword to Volume I), Orson Welles, and Roberto Rossellini, he became the prot�g� of Fran�ois Truffaut, who honors him touchingly in his forword to Volume II. This new edition includes graceful forewords to each volume by Bazin scholar and biographer Dudley Andrew, who reconsiders Bazin and his place in contemporary film study. The essays themselves are erudite but always accessible, intellectual, and stimulating. As Renoir puts it, the essays of Bazin "will survive even if the cinema does not."</p><p>"Although Andr� Bazin died shortly before the onset of what we now regard as the modern cinema, our understanding of this cinema wouldn't be the same without him. He's also one of the most scrupulous humanists and polemicists we've had, on a par with George Orwell, and these essays map out the busy highways we're all still navigating."&#x2015;Jonathan Rosenbaum, film critic for the <i>Chicago Reader </i><br><br>"<i>What Is Cinema?</i> remains an invaluable&#x2015;and beautiful&#x2015;landmark in film and media studies.

The editor's afterword tells how Twain came to write the "Diaries," which are recognized today as his most personal works of fiction.<br><br>"Funny? Yes. And you expect that from Twain. But this is also a love story... " --Birmingham Weekly, May 1999<br><br>"The sort of book that makes for deeply satisfying reading... one of the great love stories of all time." --The Mark Twain Forum, January 1999</p><p>The Diaries--written near the end of Mark Twain&#39;s life and career--are perhaps his wisest, most personal works. The wry humor we expect is matched by a heartbreaking tenderness found nowhere else in his writings. And it was only in Eve that Twain ever wrote from a woman&#39;s viewpoint.

James Thorpe's comprehensive biography of Huntington tells the richly human story of the man who became America's greatest book collector and was a leading figure in the development of southern California.<br><br>Henry Edwards Huntington was born in New York State in 1850. He began working at the age of 17, eventually moved to California, and in later years was hailed for his vision in developing the street railway system that created the structure of the Los Angeles area. Always a lover of books, Huntington acquired many spectacular volumes&#x2015;among them the complete Gutenberg Bible on vellum and the library of the Earl of Bridgewater. He also built a splendid art collection and established a grand botanical garden on the grounds of the buildings that would house his art and books. Then, in an act of philanthropy seldom equaled, he gave these great treasures to the public.<br><br>The intimate side of Huntington's life appears in these pages, too. Thorpe has culled a vast trove of private letters, diaries, and other documents that reveal Huntington's exceptional personal qualities. The author's well-rounded biography of this unassuming yet gifted American is also richly evocative of the times in which Henry Edwards Huntington lived.</p><p><b>James Thorpe</b> is a distinguished scholar and former director of the Huntington Library, Art Gallery, and Botanical Gardens from 1966-1983.

Will Eisner uses the idea of extraterrestrial contact to explore the weird happenings right here at home in <i>Life on Another Planet</i>. Serialized in the late 1970s and collected in the graphic-novel form that Eisner both invented and perfected, the story follows scientists, politicians, spies, and nobodies as they struggle to reach their own goals amidst this international crisis. The author paints his characters with broad strokes, and though his science is a little off base and his political satire dated, the novel still mines that same vein of deep truths that Eisner can find running through any subject. <i>--Rob Lightner</i>Born in New York City, Will Eisner (1917&#x2013;2005) was the author of the legendary comic strip The Spirit, as well as fifteen graphic novels and three influential instructional textbooks.

This work presents a new, synthetic portrait of the artist&#x2019;s development from the 1280s to his death in 1322, and evaluates his pivotal role in the social-political context in Yuan China as well as the development of the artist&#x2019;s self-consciousness. Shane McCausland&#x2019;s study features detailed interpretation of pictorial forms in light of historical changes, and close readings of critical colophons, many appended to artworks, but neglected as visual sources. These readings are meant to stimulate visual analysis of the oeuvre as well as debate about the use of Tang (618&#x2013;907) and other period modes as models for the &#x2018;Yuan renaissance&#x2019;. The book challenges stereotypes portraying Zhao Mengfu as a traitor or careerist. The historical background of dynastic change and Mongol rule is treated in a revisionist manner that aims to contextualize the traditional Chinese hostility towards Zhao Mengfu as a Yuan scholar-official. The concern here is for his development, in the context of Mongol rule, as a Chinese scholar-artist. This book is a must for scholars, curators and other specialists in Chinese painting and calligraphy, especially those focusing on Yuan dynasty and literati painting.</p><p>Shane McCausland is Senior Lecturer in Chinese art in the Department of the History of Art and Archaeology at SOAS, University of London.&#x201c;Shane McCausland&#x2019;s study of Zhao Mengfu as a calligrapher and painter is a pleasure to read and a major contribution to the field of Chinese art studies.

It saw the end of the Apollo moon programme and the start of the ecology movement. This proved to be one of the most complicated periods for the science-fiction magazines. Not only were they struggling to survive within the economic climate, they also had to cope with the death of the father of modern science fiction, John W. Campbell, Jr., while facing new and potentially threatening opposition. The market for science fiction diversified as never before, with the growth in new anthologies, the emergence of semi-professional magazines, the explosion of science fiction in college, the start of role-playing gaming magazines, underground and adult comics and, with the success of Star Wars, media magazines.

The founders claimed that they intended to create both a landed state for the Jewish people and a socialist society. However, according to Sternhell, socialism served the leaders of the influential labor movement more as a rhetorical resource for the legitimation of the national project of establishing a Jewish state than as a blueprint for a just society. In this thought-provoking book, Sternhell demonstrates how socialist principles were consistently subverted in practice by the nationalist goals to which socialist Zionism was committed.</p><br><p> Sternhell explains how the avowedly socialist leaders of the dominant labor party, Mapai, especially David Ben Gurion and Berl Katznelson, never really believed in the prospects of realizing the "dream" of a new society, even though many of their working-class supporters were self-identified socialists. The founders of the state understood, from the very beginning, that not only socialism but also other universalistic ideologies like liberalism, were incompatible with cultural, historical, and territorial nationalism. Because nationalism took precedence over universal values, argues Sternhell, Israel has not evolved a constitution or a Bill of Rights, has not moved to separate state and religion, has failed to develop a liberal concept of citizenship, and, until the Oslo accords of 1993, did not recognize the rights of the Palestinians to independence.</p><br><p> This is a controversial and timely book, which not only provides useful historical background to Israel's ongoing struggle to mobilize its citizenry to support a shared vision of nationhood, but also raises a question of general significance: is a national movement whose aim is a political and cultural revolution capable of coexisting with the universal values of secularism, individualism, and social justice? This bold critical reevaluation will unsettle long-standing myths as it contributes to a fresh new historiography of Zionism and Israel. At the same time, while it examines the past, <i>The Founding Myths of Israel</i> reflects profoundly on the future of the Jewish State.</p></p><p><br><p>"Sternhell's objective is to take a complete inventory of [two forces shaping Israeli identity]: nationalism and socialism.

In addition to elaborating and persuasively defending a position of her own which adroitly steers between the Scylla of apriorism and the Charybdis of scientism, Haack discusses and makes powerful and highly detailed criticisms of the views of a range of contemporary philosophers - Sir Karl Popper, W. V. O. Quine, Richard Rorty, Alvin Goldman, and Paul and Patricia Churchland, among others - criticisms to which these philosophers and their numerous admirers will have to reply." <i>Hilary Putnam, Harvard University</i></p> <p>"In summary, the book presents a good critical examination of recent work in epistemology. Even if one questions the adequacy of Haack's justification of foundherentism, the theory deserves careful examination." <i>Daniel E Flage, James Madison University for The Review of Metaphysics</i></p> <p>"This book lives up to its subtitle. It includes a powerful and valuable critique of recent epistemology, meticulously distinguishing theses which are often merged; and it argues for a theory of justification which is strongly coherentist but allows for empirical input." <i>Australasian Journal of Philosophy</i></p> <p><br> "Susan Haack here offers a new look at traditional theory of knowledge. She knows the subject well and proposes reasonable and original solutions to its problems. The book is forceful and refreshing and very much worth the attention of anyone who is interested in epistemology." <i>Roderick M. Chisholm, Brown University</i></p> <p>"I read Susan Haack's book with both pleasure and profit. It contains a uniquely thorough critique of standard epistemological theories and of more recent attempts (eg. Rorty's) to discredit, or replace, the whole analytical enterprise. The failures of traditional foundationalist and coherence accounts are plainly displayed and a satisfying synthesis of the legitimate elements in both is achieved. The whole is done with an exemplary clarity." <i>Sir Peter Strawson, Magdalen College, Oxford</i></p> <p>"Susan Haack's book is a most impressive contribution to the recent revival of epistemology. It is at once comprehensive - both in the range of problems that it deals with and in the wealth of recent discussion that it examines - and judicious - in the care with which things often confused are discriminated and with which conclusions are kept firmly in touch with the reasons that support them.

This new science studies development in the real world of predators, pathogens, competitors, symbionts, toxic compounds, temperature changes, and nutritional differences. These environmental agents can result in changes to an individual s phenotype, often implemented when signals from the environment elicit epigenetic changes in gene expression. Ecological developmental biology is a truly integrative biology, detailing the interactions between developing organisms and their environmental contexts. Ecological developmental biology also provides a systems approach to the study of pathology, integrating the studies of diabetes, cancers, obesity, and the aging syndrome into the framework of an ecologically sensitive developmental biology. It looks at examples where the environment provides expected cues for normal development and where the organism develops improperly without such cues. Data from research on teratology, endocrine disruptors, and microbial symbioses, when integrated into a developmental context, may have enormous implications for human health as well as the overall health of Earth s ecosystems. The study of epigenetics changes in gene expression that are not the result of changes in a gene s DNA sequence has recently provided startling insights not only into mechanisms of development, but also into the mechanisms and processes of evolution. The notion that epialleles (changes in chromosome structure that alter gene expression) can be induced by environmental agents and transmitted across generations has altered our notions of evolution, as have new experiments documenting the genetic fixation of environmentally induced changes in development. The widespread use of symbiosis in development provides new targets for natural selection. Ecological developmental biology integrates these new ideas into an extended evolutionary synthesis that retains and enriches the notion of evolution by natural selection.</p><p><p><strong>Scott F.

Bach in countless performances and recordings, the composer himself still comes across only as an enigmatic figure in a single familiar portrait. As we mark the 250th anniversary of Bach's death, author and leading Bach scholar, here Christoph Wolff<br>presents a new picture that brings to life this towering figure of the Baroque era.<br><br>This engaging new biography portrays Bach as the living, breathing, and sometimes imperfect human being that he was, while bringing to bear all the advances of the last half-century of Bach scholarship. Wolff demonstrates the intimate connection between the composer's life and his music, showing<br>how Bach's superb inventiveness pervaded his career as a musician, composer, performer, scholar, and teacher. And throughout, we see Bach in the broader context of his time: its institutions, traditions, and influences. With this highly readable book, Wolff sets a new standard for Bach<br>biography.</p><p><i>The Learned Musician</i> is an apt subtitle for this intellectual biography, which assesses the career of Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750) with the scholarly rigor one would expect from a Harvard professor. Opening with a 1737 attack by a critic who labeled Bach a pedant who spoiled the natural beauty of his creations with "an excess of art," Christoph Wolff cogently compares the German composer to English scientist Isaac Newton. Both men "brought about fundamental changes and established new principles" in their chosen fields, he argues; both sought to reveal God's harmonious ordering of their world. While Wolff conscientiously covers the basics of Bach's life, including his two marriages and the musical achievements of his gifted family, the author's primary focus is on his performing (Bach was an unrivaled organist) and composing. From the <i>Goldberg Variations</i> through the <i>Brandenburg Concertos</i> to <i>Art of the Fugue</i>, Wolff carefully analyzes Bach's innovations in harmony and counterpoint, placing them in the context of European musical and social history rendered in nicely atmospheric detail. Casual readers may find this dense tome a bit daunting, but serious music lovers will relish the deeper understanding it conveys of a genius who transformed Western music. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Christoph Wolff, William Powell Mason Professor of Music and Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Harvard University.</p><h2>Never at Rest: A Biography of Isaac Newton</h2><p>This richly detailed 1981 biography captures both the personal life and the scientific career of Isaac Newton, presenting a fully rounded picture of Newton the man, the scientist, the philosopher, the theologian, and the public figure. Professor Westfall treats all aspects of Newton&#39;s career, but his account centres on a full description of Newton&#39;s achievements in science. Thus the core of the work describes the development of the calculus, the experimentation that altered the direction of the science of optics, and especially the investigations in celestial dynamics that led to the law of universal gravitation.</p><p>Destined to become the standard biography of Isaac Newton, this meticulously detailed work is focused on his scientific career, but also deals with every facet of his life. It presents an encompassing picture of Newton--the man, scientist, philosopher, theologian and public figure."The hallmarks are impeccable detail and clarity...The copious footnotes, for example, generally refer to original manuscripts, letters and memoranda that are out of reach of most students and scholars. The superb quality of this book promises to give it a prominent place in the modern scholarly literature about Isaac Newton." David L.

It is more than merely the biography of a man and an account of the development of his ideas.

With the super-rich setting the pace, everyone spent furiously in a desperate attempt to keep up. As cars and houses grew larger and more expensive, the costs were enormous--not only monetarily but also socially. Consumers spent more time at work and less time with their family and friends; they saved less money and borrowed more.</p><p>In this book, Robert Frank presents the first comprehensive and accessible account of these financial choices. Frank uses scientific evidence to demonstrate how these spending patterns have not made us happier or healthier. <i>Luxury Fever</i> offers an exit from the rat race, suggesting ways to curb the culture of excess and restore true value to our lives.</p></p><p><i>Luxury Fever: Why Money Fails to Satisfy in an Era of Excess</i> is a serious examination of the long-term costs associated with our society's ever-accelerating spiral of conspicuous consumption, followed by a far-reaching remedy that will intrigue anyone concerned with related fiscal issues. Robert Frank, a Cornell University professor of economics, ethics, and public policy, who previously coauthored <i>The Winner-Take-All Society</i>, believes neither foolishness nor greed is really responsible for our relentless desire to own flashier household appliances, bigger sport-utility vehicles, and fancier suburban houses; rather, he contends, it is the ongoing behavior of our peers which ultimately determines how much we spend and how we spend it. Frank goes on to claim, however, that this knowledge alone may actually point us toward an alternative that is both acceptable and practical. "By a simple and easily achieved rearrangement of our current consumption incentives," he writes, "we can effectively enrich ourselves by literally trillions of dollars a year." He then goes on to discuss the recent boom in luxury spending, its potential implications for those at all income levels, his suggestions for altering current consumption patterns, and the reasons that redirecting these funds could benefit everyone. <i>--Howard Rothman</i><b>Robert H.

Nietzsche offered a philosophical declaration of independence from humility, a meeting-point of sobriety and megalomania that for Sloterdijk has come to define the very project of philosophy.</p><p>Yet for all the significance of this language-event named Nietzsche, Nietzsche's contributions have too often been elided and the contradictions at the root of his philosophy too often edited out. As Sloterdijk observes, &#x201c;Never has an author so insisted on distinction and yet attracted such vulgarity.&#x201d; <i>Nietzsche Apostle</i>, drawn from a speech Sloterdijk gave in 2000 on the hundredth anniversary of Nietzsche's death, looks at the ways in which Nietzsche has been branded over the years through selective compilation, and at the ways in which Nietzsche turned himself into a brand&#x2015;a brand announced by his proclaimed &#x201c;fifth Gospel,&#x201d; <i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</i>. For Sloterdijk, the focus should not be on the figure of Zarathustra or on the &#x201c;will to power&#x201d; often used as a kind of philosophical shorthand to sum up Nietzsche's work, but on Zarathustra's act of &#x201c;speaking&#x201d; itself. <i>Nietzsche Apostle</i> offers a brief history of self-praise and self-affirmation, an examination of the evolution of boasting (both by God and by man), and a very original approach to Nietzsche, philosophy's first designer brand of individualism.</p></p><p>Peter Sloterdijk (b. 1947) is one of the best known and widely read German intellectuals writing today. His 1983 publication of <i>Critique of Cynical Reason</i> (published in English in 1988) became the best-selling German book of philosophy since World War II. He became president of the State Academy of Design at the Center for Art and Media in Karlsruhe in 2001.

While you may be thinking of the criminal justice system, the previous description refers to a parallel system that preys on the elderly and is determined to deem them unable to care for themselves.

Dr. Sugar received his MD from the Abraham Lincoln College of Medicine at the University of Illinois, Chicago. He achieved certification as a specialist in internal medicine from the American Board of Internal Medicine and was distinguished as a fellow of the American College of Physicians. He has served as the director for managed care at Evanston/Northwestern Healthcare, and has taught at both Northwestern University&#x2019;s Feinberg School of Medicine and the Chicago Medical School.<br><br>In 2014, after experiencing the horrors of guardianship firsthand, Dr. Sugar and Ms. Lidya Abramovici, another victim of the system, teamed up to create the Americans Against Abusive Probate Guardianship (AAAPG). Currently, Dr. Sugar lives in Hollywood, Florida, with his wife, Judy.</p><p><strong>Acknowledgments</strong><strong><br></strong><em><strong><br></strong></em>Exposing a monolithic scheme that exploits people just like you can be a very lonely undertaking. Writing a book like this is also a very personal experience. In my case, I was able to draw on the people and incredible stories I&#x2019;ve been dealing with in my role as founder of Americans Against Abusive Probate Guardianship (AAAPG), as well as the advice of my parents. My experience in the practice of internal medicine for over forty-five years was instrumental in helping me understand the fallout, both physical and emotional, of being involved in this egregious &#x201c;industry&#x201d; of elder abuse.<br><br>My parents survived the Holocaust, making me a second-generation Holocaust survivor&#x2015;an identity that I have only recently begun to embrace, but one that surely influenced my determination to expose this governmental scheme that destroys people and families. My parents taught me the nobility of fighting against all odds to survive. They insisted that their children&#x2015;myself and my two brothers, David and Michael&#x2015;always comport themselves with integrity. Although my parents were not the beneficiaries of higher education, their strength of will and purpose made them seem far more noble to me than any of my very highly educated circle of friends and colleagues.<br><br>I&nbsp;became passionate about this subject and decided to write this book after having been exposed to the guardianship process through the experiences of a loved one. I witnessed how overwhelming the guardianship process can be and how seemingly impossible it is to prevent or stop. This ordeal introduced me to outrages that I have since seen repeated countless times in the American professional guardianship industry.<br><br>I hope that through this book those suffering as a result of guardianship will derive some solace, and that this scheme will now become something other than a secret weapon unleashed on so many individuals and families.<br><br>Early on, I developed a relationship with the late Latifa Ring, whose own personal experience with guardianship ultimately killed her with what I believe was a stress-induced malignancy. She was one of the first people to recognize the evil nature of guardianship and fought with every ounce of her being against it.<br><br>Attorney Ken Ditkowsky, from my hometown of Chicago, is another advocate who continues to expose the evil that is abusive guardianship. His vast experience in the law has been of great assistance to me in understanding the nuts and bolts of what guardianship should be, as well as what it actually is.<br><br>I met Lidya Abaramovici by accident and found that we had both suffered from the slings and arrows of guardianship. We developed a wonderful working relationship. Without her, none of the accomplishments of our group would have been possible. She is a dynamo and a true warrior for justice.<br><br>Another warrior is Doug Franks, who spent every waking moment of his life fighting for the freedom of his mother, Ernestine, until her passing, and even since then. He endured threats of incarceration and enormous monetary sacrifice to let the world know what guardianship did to his mother and family. Driving around all of Florida with his &#x201c;Free Ernestine&#x201d; banner prominently displayed on his car probably brought more attention to this cause than anything else.<br><br>Lynn and Alan Sayler have been unwavering supporters of our work. They are committed to seeing justice done for victims like Lynn&#x2019;s mother, who died in guardianship.<br><br>Attorney Greg Coleman, former president of the Florida Bar Association and a member of the Judicial Qualifications Committee, has been generous with his time and advice since the week he became president of the bar. He showed compassion and understanding of the issue and has always been a friend and a resource to me.<br><br>John Pacenti, an extraordinary investigative reporter in Palm Beach, Florida, called me at the very beginning of my journey in guardianship and wanted a story from me about the subject. At the time, I was so terrified that I refused to speak to him or give him my full contact information. He persisted and, some time later, he and I began a collaboration that has spanned half a decade and resulted in the most striking expos�s of the abject corruption in Palm Beach Circuit Court. John is a brave and courageous man who stands up for the truth and for people who have been so badly injured by the court corruption he writes about. I am honored to call him my friend.<br><br>Attorney Michael Schlesinger of Miami, Florida, has allowed me to retain a little faith in the legal profession. He has done his best to help my family and the countless others who have been referred to him. His candor, professionalism, and diligence were exactly what we needed in a time of desperate legal peril, from which he helped us escape with his expertise in our appeal to the third District Court of Appeal in Miami.<br><br>From the time I met her near Orlando, Florida, where we filmed our documentary <strong><em>Broken</em></strong>, Kelley Smoot Garrett has been a brave, wonderful, and dedicated colleague. Her energy, skill, and dedication are endless. Without her and her expertise in IT, our message would have reached far fewer people.<br><br>A very special thank you to my great friend Jon Huntsman Sr., whose generosity and faith in me allowed for the creation of AAAPG and all it has accomplished.<br><br>I want to thank Ally Cirruzzo and Michael Weatherhead, my editors, as well as Anthony Pomes, at Square One Publishers, for their tireless work on this project. Their patience and skills were the glue that held it all together.<br><br>The victims of abusive guardianship who call us for help deserve recognition as well. I hope that over time, the number of victims, the number of guardianships, and the number of horrific stories will decrease.<br><br>My wife Judy is a special woman. Her strength of character and love for me sustained me in times of trouble. Her courage and wisdom in the face of adversity has sustained me and given me hope. Without her love and support this book could never have been written. I love and treasure you, Judy. This book is in honor of you and in loving memory of Chayele.</p> <p></p></p><h2>Strategic Marketing for Nonprofit Organizations</h2><p><p> <b> </b> Reflecting the most recent, relevant information in the field, this best-selling book offers readers a practical foundation for marketing in nonprofit organizations. <b> </b> Its coverage encompasses the entire marketing process, providing valuable insights on strategic evaluations, positioning, market targeting, and more. <b> </b> For managers and future managers of nonprofit organizations, for-profit organizations, and government agencies. </p></p><p>Reflecting the most recent, relevant information in the field, this best- selling text forms a conceptual and practical foundation for marketing in nonprofit organizations.

Much more strongly than in previous editions, this book seeks to position marketing as perhaps the most critical&#x2014;if not <i>the</i> most critical&#x2014;discipline needed for nonprofit success. It argues that success ultimately requires the influencing of the behavior in a wide range of key target markets&#x2014;clients, fenders, polity makers, volunteers, the media as well as the nonprofit's own staff: This is the province of marketing! Marketers are the "behavioral influence business:" The book positions marketing as absolutely central to top management's achievement of the organization's mission. Implicit in this volume is the notion that everyone in nonprofit management&#x2014;including the CEO&#x2014;ought to have a thorough grounding in marketing and what it does and can do.<br> &#x2014; <i>Alan R.

These questions make up the first problem, the child's notion of reality.<br><br>A second fundamental problem is the significance of explanations put forward by the child.

For Russell Harrison, he was also a &#34;social lyricist&#34; a proletarian poet who saw life-on-the-job in the United States as deadening, demoralizing, yet also the stuff of art. In this collection of essays on Bukowski&#39;s poetry and fiction, Harrison is at his most original when tracing influences on the artist&#39;s work (from the Surrealists to Jackie Gleason) and when offering us Buk as the anti-Ben Franklin (that is, as the man who defined success as refusing the American Dream).</p><p>Russell Harrison (b. 1944) is an associate professor of American literature at Hofstra University. He lives in Brooklyn, New York.Although Harrison's writings on Bukowski's poetry and fiction are scholarly, they are hardly unpartisan, adopting an almost strident tone in arguments that the late poet's work remains unjustly unappreciated. By his death this past year, Bukowski had written for 50 years and published five novels (most recently Pulp), five short story collections and 10 poetry collections. But, Harrison argues consistently if not always convincingly, Bukowski has been ignored by academics and anthologists in part because he doesn't fit neatly into a genre and in part because his subject is the working class. Harrison presents Bukowski as a ``social lyricist'' and ``a proletarian poet'' who saw life in America as deadening, routinized, and whose achievement was to make poetry out of his refusal to buy into the American Dream. Harrison is at his most helpful when tracing the literary and popular influences in Bukowski's work, from the Surrealists and Bertold Brecht to Henry Miller and Jackie Gleason. Harrison quotes extensively from Bukowski's writings and analyzes their message in hopes of gaining a sympathetic and wider audience for a poet who defies convention. <p></p><p>Copyright 1994 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Classic Supernatural Stories: (Barnes &amp; Noble Collectible Editions) (Barnes &amp; Noble Leatherbound Classics)</h2><p>This volume is a cornucopia of thrills and chills, featuring 25 tales of the uncanny and macabre regarded to be among the finest weird tales in the English language.

The Bactrian camel, one of two species of camel, is native to Central Asia and hasbeen used domestically in the area for thousands of years. Even though there are overtwo million domesticated Bactrian camels, only about a thousand are considered wild. The Bactrian camel is a large animal at 6 to 7.5 feet in height and 7.4 to 11.5 feet inlength. An adult will typically weigh between 660 and 2,200 pounds. The Bactrian camelis distinctive for its two large humps on their back, hefty wooly coat, and dark browncolor. It is a herbivore that will eat all kinds of vegetation, though they have been knownto feed on dead animals.</p> <p><b></b></p><p></p> <p>Humans have domesticated the Bactrian camel for travel purposes because of its greatnatural resiliency. For example, the Bactrian camel can thrive in habitats of both extremecold and heat. It can also go without water for months and when water is available itcan consume up to 55 litres.

Penkovsky may not, literally, have saved the world, this tellingly detailed saga reconfirms that the turncoat GRU colonel provided the West with priceless intelligence during the early 1960's, when the cold war very nearly turned hot. Drawing on hitherto unavailable transcripts of Penkovsky's debriefings by the CIA and the UK's MI6, Schecter (coauthor, Back in the U.S.S.R., etc.) and former KGB officer Deriabin (The KGB, 1989, etc.) deliver a fascinating rundown on a defector in place who wreaked incalculable havoc on the Soviet regime. With his own military career stalled by dint of a White Russian father who had fought the Bolsheviks, Penkovsky offered himself to the West as a ``soldier of freedom.'' Eventually accepted as a genuine apostate, he proved an astonishingly fertile source of accurate data on the USSR's nuclear capabilities, geopolitical aspirations, industrial priorities, and allied matters. Under his cover as a trade official, the GRU operative often traveled to London, Paris, and other points beyond the Socialist Bloc to talk with his Western contacts; otherwise, the high-ranking mole was obliged to pass on his espionage material (including exposed microfilm) at dead drops or embassy receptions in Moscow. Penkovsky's information proved invaluable to JFK in his confrontations with Khrushchev prior to the Berlin Wall, as well as during the Cuban missile crisis. In the meantime, however, Penkovsky took one risk too many and was arrested by the KGB and, following a show trial, executed in 1965. Having evaluated the theories advanced to explain Penkovsky's apprehension, the authors conclude that the truth won't be known until Kremlin files are opened. They leave little doubt, though, that their philandering, money-minded subject would probably have remained a loyal apparatchik had not his patrimony precluded his promotion to general. A fascinating portrait of a double agent whose active disaffection with the communist system helped consign it to history's dustbin. (Eight pages of photos--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>During the Cold War the CIA's premier agent in the Soviet Union was a high-level intelligence officer named Oleg Penkovsky. For two years in the early 1960s he supplied the CIA with highly classified information on Soviet rocket strength and strategic planning, information that assisted President Kennedy in his handling of the world's first nuclear confrontation, the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. In the author's view, no spy in history has provided more useful material or had greater impact. Granted access to transcripts of Penkovsky's debriefings in Paris and London by U.S. and British intelligence, Schecter and Deriabin bring into focus for the first time Penkovsky's character and personality, his motivations for betraying his country, and the dimensions of the risks he took. The book concludes with a gripping account of how Penkovsky was caught by the KGB, his trial and 1963 execution. The authors call Penkovsky a fearless prophet whose heroism saved the world from nuclear war. A thoroughly good read, the book is rich in details of intelligence fieldcraft and specifics on how the CIA "ran" its operatives. Schecter is a former Time-Life bureau chief in Moscow; Deriabin, a former KGB official, defected to the West in 1954.

Brooks Simpson meets that need for the 1990s in America's Civil War, a wonderful feat of compression in which he addresses all the great issues of the war in 200 pages of clear and readable prose. Rightly, he puts the military history of the conflict at the center of the picture, but he excels in relating the drama of the war itself to the politics of both Union and Confederacy, to the stresses and strains-and opportunities-of the home front, and to the great issues of emancipation and reconstruction. This book is a fine achievement, and it will be invaluable not only to students but to many other readers-and even Civil War specialists will benefit from its fresh insights.&#x2013;Peter J.

(<i>CHOICE</i>, September 1996)</p> <p>"This work finally condenses the story of the War to a manageable size for the beginner and student alike. ...Written in a clear, concise manner, this book belongs on the book shelves of any collector of writings on the Civil War." (<i>The Cincinnati Civil War Round Table</i>, November 1996)</p> <p>"Students looking for a condensed, clear, and evenhanded summary of a particular campaign would do well to consult this volume. ...<i>America's Civil War</i> will be a useful supplemental reading in survey courses and a solid short text for courses on the war itself. Occupying an important niche between the single-chapter accounts of the American history textbooks and much longer single-volume treatments...Simpson's book admirably fulfills the goals of the American History Series."

In recent years, however, evolutionary genetics, with its focus on the modification and inheritance of presumed genetic programs, has all but overwhelmed other aspects of evolutionary biology. This has led to the neglect of the study of the generative origins of biological form.</p><p>Drawing on work from developmental biology, paleontology, developmental and population genetics, cancer research, physics, and theoretical biology, this book explores the multiple factors responsible for the origination of biological form. It examines the essential problems of morphological evolution&#x2015;why, for example, the basic body plans of nearly all metazoans arose within a relatively short time span, why similar morphological design motifs appear in phylogenetically independent lineages, and how new structural elements are added to the body plan of a given phylogenetic lineage. It also examines discordances between genetic and phenotypic change, the physical determinants of morphogenesis, and the role of epigenetic processes in evolution. The book discusses these and other topics within the framework of evolutionary developmental biology, a new research agenda that concerns the interaction of development and evolution in the generation of biological form. By placing epigenetic processes, rather than gene sequence and gene expression changes, at the center of morphological origination, this book points the way to a more comprehensive theory of evolution.</p></p><p>Gerd B.

Pairing with trusted veteran activists Freddy and Lyman Paine, they ruminated on central questions emerging from their politics and activism, and they discussed the purpose and responsibilities human beings share for the future. The recorded dialogue among these four friends invites readers to consider the fundamentals of activism with tough, thought-provoking questions. Their conversations at the Paines&#x2019; home on Sutton Island, Maine, not only function as political act but also present unsettling truths and develop connections between philosophy, music, art, gender difference, family structure, Marxism, and more. <i>Conversations in Maine</i> is a call to all citizens to work together and think deeply about the kind of future we can create.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Grace Lee Boggs (1915&#x2013;2015) was a first-generation Chinese American philosopher activist.

Highly enjoyable to read, it delights in exuberant language and the pleasure of discovery, very typical of the young writer who in the post-war years was to astonish the world with Waiting for Godot and Molloy. First published in 1934, &#34;More Pricks Than Kicks&#34; is Beckett&#39;s second work of fiction. It serves as an excellent introduction to the later work of one of the most seminal and exciting major writers of the twentieth century.</p><p>Samuel Beckett was born in Dublin in 1906 and graduated from Trinity College. He settled in Paris in 1937, after travels in Germany and periods of residence in London and Dublin. He remained in France during the Second World War and was active in the French Resistance. From the spring of 1946 his plays, novels, short fiction, poetry and criticism were largely written in French. With the production of En attendant Godot in Paris in 1953, Beckett&#39;s work began to achieve widespread recognition. During his subsequent career as a playwright and novelist in both French and English he redefined the possibilities of prose fiction and writing for the theatre. Samuel Beckett won the Prix Formentor in 1961 and the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1969. He died in Paris in December 1989.</p><h2>Spanish Picture Dictionary</h2><p>Colorful drawings illustrate the meanings of a wide range of common words in Spanish and English</p><p></p><h2>Infinite City: A San Francisco Atlas</h2><p>What makes a place? <i>Infinite City</i>, Rebecca Solnit&#x2019;s brilliant reinvention of the traditional atlas, searches out the answer by examining the many layers of meaning in one place, the San Francisco Bay Area. Aided by artists, writers, cartographers, and twenty-two gorgeous color maps, each of which illuminates the city and its surroundings as experienced by different inhabitants, Solnit takes us on a tour that will forever change the way we think about place. She explores the area thematically&#x2015;connecting, for example, Eadweard Muybridge&#x2019;s foundation of motion-picture technology with Alfred Hitchcock&#x2019;s filming of <i>Vertigo.</i> Across an urban grid of just seven by seven miles, she finds seemingly unlimited landmarks and treasures&#x2015;butterfly habitats, queer sites, murders, World War II shipyards, blues clubs, Zen Buddhist centers. She roams the political terrain, both progressive and conservative, and details the cultural geographies of the Mission District, the culture wars of the Fillmore, the South of Market world being devoured by redevelopment, and much, much more. Breathtakingly original, this atlas of the imagination invites us to search out the layers of San Francisco that carry meaning for us&#x2015;or to discover our own infinite city, be it Cleveland, Toulouse, or Shanghai. <br><br>CONTRIBUTORS:<br><br>Cartographers: Ben Pease and Shizue Seigel<br><br>Designer: Lia Tjandra<br><br>Artists: Sandow Birk, Mona Caron, Jaime Cortez, Hugh D'Andrade, Robert Dawson, Paz de la Calzada, Jim Herrington, Ira Nowinski, Alison Pebworth, Michael Rauner, Gent Sturgeon, Sunaura Taylor<br><br>Writers and researchers: Summer Brenner, Adriana Camarena, Chris Carlsson, Lisa Conrad, Guillermo G�mez-Pe�a, Joshua Jelly-Schapiro, Paul La Farge, Genine Lentine, Stella Lochman, Aaron Shurin, Heather Smith, Richard Walker<br><br>Additional cartography: Darin Jensen; Robin Grossinger and Ruth Askevold, San Francisco Estuary Institute</p><p>"At last a field book with the sense of San Francisco&#x2014;the non sense, the real sense, the mysteries of the microclimates, gays and butterflies, gangs, boulevards and mysterious alleys.

Coverage is, within the scope of the work, thorough. For example, prominent figures such as Augustine and Origen are covered in appropriate depth. More obscure persons are given briefer entries. Although the encyclopedia is advertised as a resource for scholars, students, and general readers, the latter may labor through many of the articles. First, the style of some of the articles borders on pedantic. Second, a number of the authors use untranslated Latin and Greek terminology and occasionally cite primary sources by their Greek and Latin titles even when English translations are available. For these reasons, general readers and lower-level undergraduates may be better served by the Encyclopedia of Early Christianity , edited by Everett Ferguson ( LJ 5/1/90). However, graduate students and scholars will turn to these volumes time after time. Recommended for seminary, academic, and large public libraries.<br><i>-Craig W.

Quantum field theory, however, is a subject that has been discussed mostly by physicists. This is the first book to present quantum field theory in a manner that makes it accessible to philosophers. Because it presents a lucid view of the theory and debates that surround the theory, <i>An Interpretive Introduction to Quantum Field Theory</i> will interest students of physics as well as students of philosophy.</p><br><p> Paul Teller presents the basic ideas of quantum field theory in a way that is understandable to readers who are familiar with non-relativistic quantum mechanics. He provides information about the physics of the theory without calculational detail, and he enlightens readers on how to think about the theory physically. Along the way, he dismantles some popular myths and clarifies the novel ways in which quantum field theory is both a theory about fields and about particles. His goal is to raise questions about the philosophical implications of the theory and to offer some tentative interpretive views of his own. This provocative and thoughtful book challenges philosophers to extend their thinking beyond the realm of quantum mechanics and it challenges physicists to consider the philosophical issues that their explorations have encouraged.</p></p><p><p>"In discussing the philosophical implications of quantum field theory, this book is groundbreaking. Teller has provided a real service by distilling the central notions so as to be accessible to the non-expert."--<b>Tim Maudlin, Rutgers University</b></p><b>Paul Teller</b> is Professor of Philosophy at the University of California at Davis.</p><h2>The Co-Creation Handbook: A Shamanic Guide to Manifesting a Better World and a More Joyful Life</h2><p><p><b><strong><em>The Co-Creation Handbook</em></strong> is an interactive eight-week process that teaches application of Universal spiritual principles.

Usually that process gets forgotten once the new poem stands intact in translation. Yet a verse translation derives from historical, biographical, and philosophical research, interpretive analysis of the original poem, and continuous linguistic and prosodic choices that parallel those the poet made. Taking as a text Pablo Neruda's brilliant prophetic sequence <i>Alturas de Macchu Picchu</i> (1945), the author here re-creates the entire process of translation, from his first encounter with the poem to the last shaping of a phrase that may never come right in English. This many-faceted book forms an essay on the theory and practice of literary translation, a study of Neruda's career through 1945, and an interpretation of his major poem, all of which lead to a striking new poem in English, <i>Heights of Macchu Picchu</i>, printed along with the original Spanish. This genesis of a verse translation also includes little-known biographical data, hitherto untranslated poems and prose from the years 1920 to 1945, and new translations of key poems from Neruda's <i>Residence on Earth</i> and <i>Spain in My Heart</i>.</p><p>John Felstiner is Professor of English at Stanford UniversityText: English, Spanish</p><h2>Practical Foundation Engineering Handbook</h2><p>Structural foundation answers on demand!

Rather than force too much unanimity, the editors have opted to feature a wide array of American writers, from freed slaves to founding fathers to scholars. Because the book does not include many 20th-century pieces, it functions primarily as a history of American philosophy. As expected, readers will find selections from William James, John Dewey, C.S. Pierce, Walt Whitman, Henry David Thoreau, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. But the anthology's real brilliance comes from the polemical and contentious views of the voices that have also created America. The book includes a host of unlikely bedfellows: there is King Ferdinand of Aragon's threatening letter in 1493 to the region's newly discovered Indians, demanding that they "recognize the Church and its highest priest, the Pope, as rulers of the universe, and in their name the King and Queen of Spain as rulers of this land." There is Luther Standing Bear in 1933: "every problem that exists today in regard to the native population is due to the white man's cast of mind." There is the puritan preacher Jonathan Edwards on original sin. And there is feminist Emma Goldman defining anarchy. Editors Leonard Harris, Scott L. Pratt, and Anne Waters have given us a volume that is more than the usual collection of white male philosophers, and the result is "a chorus of voices--sometimes in unison, sometimes creating a discordant wail." <i>--Eric de Place</i>This anthology promotes a new vision: American Philosophy as complex and constantly changing, enlivened by historically marginalized, yet never silent, voices. The readings provide a sense of the history and context of sophisticated, ongoing philosophical arguments. Some of the pressing questions considered are:<br> <ul> <li><br> </li> <li>What should be the future of all persons, particularly Americans?</li> <li><br> </li> <li>What does it mean to be native, African, or of European heritage in America, in relation to the aims of humanity?</li> <li><br> </li> <li>What type of community is warranted given the reality of a vast array of competing interests, cultures, and ideals?</li> <li><br> </li> <li>What moral commitments and duties should we have to strangers in light of the institution of slavery and the history of ethnocide?</li> </ul> <br> <p>By offering readings from different traditions, <i>American Philosophies: An Anthology</i> offers an informed view of the past, while compelling the reader to rethink the meaning of American Philosophy.</p></p><h2>Dominion from Sea to Sea: Pacific Ascendancy and American Power</h2><p><p>America is the first world power to inhabit an immense land mass open at both ends to the world&#x2019;s two largest oceans&#x2014;the Atlantic and the Pacific. This gives America a great competitive advantage often overlooked by Atlanticists, whose focus remains overwhelmingly fixed on America&#x2019;s relationship with Europe. Bruce Cumings challenges the Atlanticist perspective in this innovative new history, arguing that relations with Asia influenced our history greatly.</p><p>Cumings chronicles how the movement westward, from the Middle West to the Pacific, has shaped America&#x2019;s industrial, technological, military, and global rise to power. He unites domestic and international history, international relations, and political economy to demonstrate how technological change and sharp economic growth have created a truly bicoastal national economy that has led the world for more than a century. Cumings emphasizes the importance of American encounters with Mexico, the Philippines, and the nations of East Asia. The result is a wonderfully integrative history that advances a strong argument for a dual approach to American history incorporating both Atlanticist and Pacificist perspectives.</p></p><p><b>Bruce Cumings </b>is chair of the History Department at the University of Chicago and author of the award-winning book <i>The Origins of the Korean War.</i>"<i>Dominion from Sea to Sea</i> is both original and so well researched that I am in awe of all the work and how all that information has been integrated."&#x2014;Daniel Chirot, University of Washington (Daniel Chirot)<br><br>"In this sprawling and vastly interesting book, Bruce Cumings reorients American history from the Atlantic to the Pacific.&nbsp; Stressing America's expansionist thrusts and violent, unilateralist impulses, he illuminates how adventurers and entrepreneurs, state and federal governments, corporations and universities all collaborated to transform the West and revitalize America, especially after the Great Depression of the 1930s and the attack on Pearl Harbor.&nbsp; Rarely has a historian so evocatively and insightfully integrated the settlement of America's frontiers with the history of migration, technology, trade, agriculture, race, the environment, and foreign relations.&nbsp; <i>Dominion from Sea to Sea</i> reshapes and reorients our thinking about our nation's history; it is a book that must be read and discussed; it inspires pride and shame."&#x2014;Melvyn P. Leffler, University of Virginia (Melvyn Leffler)<br><br>"In a rich and colorful narrative Cumings sweeps the reader westward across time and space, recounting U.S. history from the perspective of the Pacific, with special attention to California on one side and East Asia on the other.&nbsp; From Jurassic trenches to Silicon Valley, he links the westering of people, technology, capitalism, and lifestyles to both domestic and foreign policy and concludes that whatever has happened to California (and hence to the country), America remains ascendant, even if it doesn't always know how to go about its global leadership.&nbsp; Agree or disagree, the story is irresistible."&#x2014;Carol Gluck, Columbia University (Carol Gluck)<br><br>"In this fascinating book, Bruce Cumings, whose scholarly work has focused on East Asia, shows that he can be just as adept and exciting in writing American history. Actually, it is a 'Pacificist' version of U.S. history. He shows that 'the American story' can never be fully told unless the Western parts of the United States as well as the Pacific region are incorporated. Describing in colorful detail developments in the Western states, including Texas, as well as the countries of East Asia, the author argues that these developments have been inseparable from the story of U.S. 'dominion from sea to sea,' or its overwhelming military presence in 'the global archipelago.' The book fits into an emerging scholarly trend, to transcend narrowly focused national narratives and to deal with larger entities and in large frameworks such as Atlantic history, Europeanization, South Asian cosmopolitanism that have already enriched our understanding of modern global history. Few historians are as capable as Cumings of launching the field of Pacific history, and readers will find in this imaginatively conceived and earnestly but also humorously presented history much that will help them understand how the United States became globalized domestically and internationally, and what the future holds both for the nation and for the world."&#x2014;Akira Iriye, Harvard University (Akira Iriye)<br><br>"This is nevertheless one of the richest and most thoughtful books of American history I have read in a long time. . . .

Dr. Karen Hayes, an equine veterinarian with a specialty in reproduction, explains how to handle a foaling?any foaling, regardless of how easy or how complicated it may turn out to be. Her feeling is that if we know what is happening inside the mare during the late stages of pregnancy and labor, we will understand what is normal and be able to recognize when something goes wrong. She takes us through the whole process step by step, from three weeks before foaling, through the new baby's first twelve hours. She even has a section on how to predict when the foaling will occur, so the designated attendant will be sure to be there when it happens. Since most foals are born at night, and it may be difficult to get help when it's needed, this book, with its 150 photographs and diagrams, can be the source of information and reassurance the foaling attendant needs.<p><i>The Complete Book of Foaling</i> not only teaches how to troubleshoot problems but also explains why a problem has occurred and what must be done to correct it. Dr. Hayes knows that the foaling process can be scary and exciting at the same time. She wants to make it the exhilarating and positive experience it is meant to be by contributing not just her expertise but that of "the silent and patient teachings of the mares and foals" she attended. "The horses are the real authors," she says. "I am privileged to be their interpreter."</p>Karen E. N.

Chase: A Biography</h2><p>Salmon P. Chase was one of the preeminent men of 19th-century America. A majestic figure, tall and stately, Chase was a leader in the fight to end slavery, a brilliant administrator who as Lincoln's Secretary of the Treasury provided crucial funding for a vastly expensive war, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court during the turmoil of Reconstruction, and the presiding officer of the impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson. Yet he was also a complex figure. As John Niven reveals in this magisterial biography, Chase was a paradoxical blend of idealism and ambition. If he stood for the highest moral purposes--the freedom and equality of all mankind--these lofty ideas failed to mask a thirst for power so deeply ingrained in his character that it drove away many who shared his principles, but mistrusted his motives.<br> Niven provides a vivid description of Chase's early years--his childhood in New Hampshire (where his father's failed business venture and early death left the family all but destitute) and in Ohio (where he was sent to live with his uncle Philander, an Episcopal bishop), his education at Dartmouth, and his early law career in Cincinnati. Niven shows how the plight of the slaves stirred this reticent young lawyer, and how Chase gradually moved to the forefront of the antislavery movement. At the same time, we see how he used his growing prominence in the antislavery movement to forward his political ambitions. Niven illuminates Chase's long tenure as a public man. Twice elected United States Senator, twice chosen governor of Ohio (then the third most populous state in the Union), Chase organized the widespread but diffuse anti-slavery movement into a workable political organization, the Free Soil party (whose slogan "Free Soil, Free Labor, Freemen" Chase coined himself). We read of Chase's work in Lincoln's war cabinet and his tenure as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and we also follow his many political maneuvers, his attempts to undercut rivals, and his poorly run campaigns for presidential nominations. Niven also provides an intimate portrait of Chase's family life--his loss of three wives and four of his six children, and the unfortunate marriage of his beautiful daughter Kate to a rich but dissolute man--and a vivid picture of life at mid-century.<br> What emerges is a portrait of a tragic figure, whose high qualities of heart and mind and whose many achievements were ultimately tarnished by an often unseemly quest for power. It is a striking look at an eminent statesman as well as a revealing glimpse into political life in 19th-century America, all set against a background of the anti-slavery movement, the Civil War, and the turmoil of Reconstruction.<br></p><p><br><strong>John Niven</strong> is Professor Emeritus of American History at Claremont Graduate School and is editor of the papers of Salmon P. Chase. His many books include <em>Gideon Welles, Lincoln's Secretary of the Navy</em>, <em>Martin Van Buren and the Romantic Era of American Politics</em>, and <em>John C. Calhoun and the Price of</em> <em>Union: A Biography</em>.<br><br>"John Niven...presents a meticulous study of Chase--the man and the politician. In the process, he throws a laser beam on the inner-workings of the Lincoln presidency and, more broadly, the politics of the age....<em>Salmon P. Chase</em> is a fine biography of a complex man maneuvering through a complex time."--<em>The Times</em> (Trenton)<p></p><br>"One of the Salmon P. Chase paradoxes is the fact that, among Lincoln's contemporaries, he has been relatively neglected because of his very importance. He was engaged in such a wide range of public activities as to intimidate biographers. Now, having mastered the sources, John Niven in the first comprehensive biography re-creates the man in all his complexity, personal as well as political. The book is as readable as it is authoritative."--Richard Nelson Current<p></p><br>"A brilliant account of the public and personal life of one of the most complex and fascinating major figures of the Civil War era."--Kenneth Stampp, author of <em>America in 1857: A Nation on the Brink</em><p></p><br>"Niven's smooth but thorough biography reminds us of the importance to history of a long-forgotten player."--<em>Booklist</em><p></p><br>"In detailing Chase's quest for ever higher office, the author reveals a complex will."--<em>The New Yorker</em> (Recommended Reading)<p></p><br>"A balanced view....A vivid sketch....Niven's scholarship is impeccable. His writing is deft....Aside from its historical value, Niven's work presents a fascinating case study of the relationships between personal ambition and social progress."--<em>Lexington Herald-Ledger</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Living Between Worlds: Place and Journey in Celtic Spirituality</h2><p>Used.

It all began while walking through a local drugstore with her mom, Maureen Rana, and seeing a Black BARBIE doll on the top shelf of the toy aisle. The doll&#39;s coif was like the style used on her 1961 Bubblecut BARBIE doll that she had when she was a little girl, and in fact still owns. The hairstyle reminded Margo so much of the one she had when she was only ten years old that her mother bought it for her. Margo thinks that her mom bought her this doll because she always felt guilty for not buying Margo her first BARBIE doll back in 1959. That same year, her mother bought her the next doll. It was a Hispanic BARBIE doll. Two dolls, back to back, both brunettes and wearing red, one of Margo&#39;s favorite colors. These two dolls were like an avalanche. Margo started haunting thrift stores, flea markets, yard sales, antique shops and doll shows. At the time she started collecting there was very little interest in BARBIE doll, her friends or her accessories. It was difficult to get information.</p><h2>Normal Development of Functional Motor Skills</h2><p>No two babies are the same.

E. Evans-Pritchard, the Nuer of southern Sudan have become one of anthropology's most celebrated case studies. Now Sharon Hutchinson combines fresh ethnographic evidence and contemporary theoretical perspectives to show not only what has happened to the Nuer since their 1930s encounters with Evans-Pritchard, but, more importantly, what is to be gained from a thoroughly historicized treatment of ethnographic materials. Hutchinson's work provides a vision for what anthropology has become in the 1990s.<br><br>Concentrating on Nuer perceptions, experiences, and evaluations of change, Hutchinson traces the historical conditions that have led contemporary men and women to reconsider fundamental aspects of their lives. She raises a number of important issues that Evans-Pritchard did not: How can we move beyond static structural models based on notions of cultural "boundedness," "homogeneity," and "order"? How have Nuer people been actively reshaping and reassessing local forms of power in light of dramatic economic shifts, religious proselytizing, civil war, and colonial and postcolonial rule?<br><br>Hutchinson has produced a rich ethnographic document that offers a new rhetorical strategy for writing ethnographies that is processual, dialogical, and reflexive all at once.</p><p>"Not just a brilliant restudy of one of anthropology's most famous 'peoples' but an exemplary historical ethnography that will be a landmark in the discipline. . . . With extraordinary sensitivity Hutchinson reveals how the Nuer have confronted the most profound moral, social, and political dilemmas of their&#x2015;and our&#x2015;changing world."&#x2015;Lila Abu-Lughod, author of <i>Writing Women's Worlds</i><b>Sharon E.

The text is organized around the four areas of emotional, intellectual, physical and social potentials. Through a process of learning and self-examination, students discover their values, increase their commitment to personal goals, and challenge themselves to grow and learn. While gaining practical knowledge and skills, students will discover their emotional, intellectual, physical, and social resources. This model, which is thematically integrated throughout the text, allows readers to emerge from their learning experience understanding the importance of developing each of these areas in order to reach their fullest potential. The text involves readers in active learning with self-assessments, activities that apply concepts to their own lives, questions that test comprehension, and case studies to foster critical-thinking skills.</p><p>Robert K.

The selections represent a wide range of contemporary creative nonfiction, including examples in essay, memoir, literary journalism, and cultural criticism. These readings establish a thorough grounding in the nature of the genre and provide excellent models for writing. The articles about nonfiction forms, issues, and writing strategies in Part II, mostly written by authors whose work appears in Part I, give readers an inside view of the writers&#39; creative processes. Part III consists of essays and memoirs paired with articles by their authors discussing the essays&#39; creation and the writers&#39; methods and strategies. Introductions to each part provide an overview of that section, preparing readers for the selections to come. Two alternative tables of contents organize the readings by subgenres and approaches, connecting the three distinctive sections of the book.

Within the special world of the department store, women found themselves challenged to resist the enticements of consumption. Many succumbed, buying both what they needed and what they desired, but also stealing what seemed so readily available. Pitted against these middle-class women were the management, detectives, and clerks of the department stores. Abelson argues that in the interest of concealing this darker side of consumerism, women of the middle class, but not those of the working class, were allowed to shoplift and plead incapacitating illness--kleptomania. The invention of kleptomania by psychiatrists and the adoption of this ideology of feminine weakness by retailers, newspapers, the general public, the accused women themselves, and even the courts reveals the way in which a gender analysis allowed proponents of consumer capitalism to mask its contradictions.<br></p><p>Elaine S. Abelson is at Eugene Lang College.<br>"More than a history of social change and shoplifting. It is a study of consumer culture and technological change, class privilege and gender roles in transition, female criminality and social control...Interesting, well-written, and informative."--<em>American Journal of Sociology</em><p></p><br>"[An] intelligent and intriguing probe into the social history of American shoplifting...A fascinating story, replete with evidence of changing and intersecting class and gender relationships.

Abelson's trenchant comments also illuminate the history of labeling in deviance and its interconnections with social and economic interests."--<em>Contemporary Sociology</em><p></p><br>"Very well written, original, and compelling. It breaks fresh ground and commands the reader's attention."--Daniel Horowitz, <em>Smith College</em><p></p><br>"The outlines of a kleptomania story have been adumbrated, but a full-fledged treatment of the subject has been wanting until the publication of Elaine Abelson's excellent and readablee account of shoplifiting in the Victorian American department store."--<em>Victorian Studies</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Order, Legitimacy, and Wealth in Ancient States (New Directions in Archaeology)</h2><p>In a very influential paper published in 1994, John Baines and Norman Yoffee produced the first analysis to examine the impact of wealth and high culture on the development of states.

Stanley Bible Study Series)</h2><p><p>Prayer is communication. It is not a formula that we have memorized, or an empty repetition of words and phrases, but our conversation with God&#x2014;with us first speaking and then listening to what God has to say to us in return. However, as Dr. Charles Stanley reveals in&nbsp;<em>Deepening Your Prayer Life</em>, our prayers go beyond mere human interaction in that it gives us access into the very throne room of God. Our heavenly Father grants us the privilege to come before him with authority because of our position in Christ. When we do, we can be bold in believing that God will accomplish what he promised he would do in our lives.</p><p>The&nbsp;<strong>Charles Stanley Bible Studies&nbsp;</strong>are a unique approach to Bible study, incorporating biblical truth, personal insights, emotional responses, and a call to action. Each study draws on Dr. Stanley's many years of teaching on the guiding principles found in God's Word, showing how we can apply them in practical ways to every situation we face. This edition of the series has been completely revised and updated and includes two brand-new lessons from Dr. Stanley.</p></p><p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Dr. Charles Stanley is the senior pastor of the First Baptist Church of Atlanta, where he has served for more than 40 years.

With prose that to Frank McCourt "flashes with poetry," <em>New York Times</em> columnist Dan Barry tells the story of an unforgettable American family. He writes so crisply that we not only feel his emotions but also recall our own: the joy of Little League, the thrill of small-town reporting, the pain of losing a parent, and the fear of facing a life-threatening illness. Barry's writing has its own stalwart beauty, a single melody teased out of the American symphony. Here is the voice of an authentic American writer. 6 illustrations</p><p>The &#34;This Land&#34; columnist for The New York Times, Dan Barry has shared a Pulitzer Prize and a George Polk Award, and received the 2003 Distinguished Writing Award from the American Society of Newspaper Editors. He lives with his family in Maplewood, New Jersey.Although Barry is the <i>New York Times</i>'s "About New York" columnist, his memoir isn't the story of his award-winning journalism career. More like Pete Hamill or Frank McCourt, Barry wants to recount growing up Irish and Catholic on Long Island in the late 1950s and '60s. "Pull me up" was his mom's morphine-soaked plea as she lay dying of lung cancer on the living room sofa-and what a shock it was that his mother was the first to go, as his father had suffered through paralyzing cluster migraines for 20 years. Barry takes readers back to what he calls the Eisenhower years, when gas stations handed out "plaid stamps," women's perms had a distinct "chemical whiff" and delis made potato salad loaded with bacon. He lovingly details seasoning his baseball mitt, oiling, binding and hiding it under his mattress. He relives his Catholic school upbringing, complete with hazing from upperclassmen and pedophilic assaults from Brother Noel, but also those wonderful teachers who helped him realize his calling as a writer. After college came various jobs and romances, even marriage and adopting a baby, all of which is very entertaining, but is horribly interrupted six months after Barry's mother dies, when he finds himself diagnosed, at age 41, with cancer. Perhaps anyone's struggle to survive a deadly illness transforms their life; as Barry puts it, he knew "what it was like to nearly drown," and then felt the "sting of a saltwater blessing" on his face. This is a beautiful book. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Tour.</p><p>In Arab Muslim communities, a most delicate taboo is discussion of so-called honor killings of women, because of the shocking barbarism the practice presents to non-Muslims. A sensational breach of the taboo occurred in 1989 in St. Louis, where Palestinian parents who were low-grade agents of the notorious Abu Nidal terrorist gang gruesomely knifed their youngest daughter to death--all recorded on tape by FBI bugs. Few crimes in recent memory have been as packed as this with explosive cross-cultural issues, for the Isa family was not here solely to make a new life in America: as shown by intelligence surveillance, which author Harris has partially pieced together from her interviews and revelations at trial, the inept and talkative Isas exposed an extended Palestinian network consumed with violent plots spawned from hate for Jews and for America and its perceived moral laxness. The latter infuriated the parents of victim Palestina, a 16-year-old who was quickly absorbing her new culture's attributes; she had a fast-food job, a boyfriend, and dreams of college. This gripping work grapples with the surveillance process and a clash of cultures with both skill and sensitivity--a perfect combination for libraries seeking a high-demand title. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i>Harris's second true-crime book (following Dying To Get Married, LJ 9/15/91) can be read on many levels; on the most obvious one, it is a well-researched account of the horrible stabbing death of 16-year-old Tina Isa at the hands of her abusive and uneducated father, Zein Isa. It also documents the reach of Palestinian fanatic Abu Nidal's international terrorist organization; Zein and several relatives worked for Abu Nidal in the United States, and this involvement may have been an underlying cause of Tina's murder. On a third level, Harris's book is a study of the clash between Palestinian and American cultures. Through extensive research and interviews with Palestinians on the West Bank and in the United States, Harris attempts?successfully for the most part?to explain Palestinian cultural beliefs and thereby to illustrate that Zein deviated from predominant practices not only when he murdered Tina in a so-called "honor killing" but frequently throughout Tina's life. This well-written and well-documented book is recommended for public libraries and others with Middle East collections.<br><i>-?Ruth K. Baacke, Whatcom Cty Lib.

But it has been hard for them to do so. Basic statistics books don't discuss curve fitting, advanced books on nonlinear regression tend to be too mathematical, and the manuals that come with computer programs tend to be too narrow. Motulsky and Christopolous do a excellent job of explaining the principles of curve fitting (with enough but not too much math) along with practical discussions of how to pick a model, how to make sense of results, what to do when the results appear to be nonsense and how to compare curves.

Collected here, these writings offer essential insights into the human condition as it is expressed in culture and society.<br> <br> Buber's central focus in his sociological work is the relation between social interaction, or intersubjectivity, and the process of human creativity. Specifically, Buber seeks to define the nature and conditions of creativity, the conditions of authentic intersubjective social relations that nurture creativity in society and culture. He attempts to identify situations favorable to creativity that he believes exist to some extent in all cultures, though their fullest development occurs only rarely.<br> <br> Buber considers the combination of open dialogue between human and human and a dialogue between man and God to be necessary for the crystallization of the common discourse that is essential for holding a free, just, and open society together.<br> <br> Important for an understanding of Buber's thought, these writings&#x2014;touching on education, religion, the state, and charismatic leadership&#x2014;will be of profound value to students of sociology, philosophy, and religion.</p></p><p><p> Martin Buber (1878 1965), is among the foremost twentieth-century philosophers of human relations and Jewish thought. He is best known for his revival of popular interest in Hasidism and his philosophy of dialogue, a form of existentialism centered on the distinction between the I-Thou and I-It relationships. His work on Hasidic thought, Zionism and religious philosophy continues to influence both the academic study of Judaism and religious thinking more broadly. He also inspired the trend toward neo-Hasidism among modern Jews. His books include I and Thou, Tales of the Hasidim, On Judaism and many others.</p></p><h2>Greek Prose Composition</h2><p>Focus Edition of the classic British text, including original typesetting.

This book offers a concise overview of this new multidisciplinary field, presenting concepts, issues, current research, concrete examples, and case studies. Robert Emmett and David Nye show how humanists, by offering constructive knowledge as well as negative critique, can improve our understanding of such environmental problems as global warming, species extinction, and over-consumption of the earth's resources. They trace the genealogy of environmental humanities from European, Australian, and American initiatives, also showing its cross-pollination by postcolonial and feminist theories. </p><p>Emmett and Nye consider a concept of place not synonymous with localism, the risks of ecotourism, and the cultivation of wild areas. They discuss the decoupling of energy use and progress, and point to OECD countries for examples of sustainable development. They explain the potential for science to do both good and harm, examine dark visions of planetary collapse, and describe more positive possibilities&#x2015;alternative practices, including localization and degrowth. Finally, they examine the theoretical impact of new materialism, feminism, postcolonial criticism, animal studies, and queer ecology on the environmental humanities.</p></p><p>Robert Emmett is Visiting Assistant Professor of Environmental Studies at Roanoke College and author of <i>Cultivating Environmental Justice: A Literary History of U.S. Garden Writing</i>.<p>This book is the best introduction to a dynamic field. It is perfect for fomenting lively classroom discussion of so many of this era's essential issues: climate change, animal sentience, environmental justice, digital and analog forms of representing the environment, the Anthropocene, food and water security, urban futures, and sustainable energy.

An influential and successful Chicago artist, he possessed a "singular vision," according to Courtney Graham Donnell, a contributor to this well produced volume. A master technician, Albright created meticulously detailed paintings, sculpted, carved his own frames, and devised a number of innovative techniques to explore his fascination with perception. A positive, energetic, and fun-loving man, he nonetheless painted dark and troubling portraits that focus, unnervingly, on decay, aging, and death. Albright wrote, "The body is our tomb," and admitted that he liked to make viewers uncomfortable by challenging their notions of art, beauty, and life. An artist with the unusual distinction of having one of his paintings star in a film, his <i>Portrait of Dorian Gray</i> (1943), Albright should be better known, and, with this outstanding monograph accompanying the striking exhibit at the Art Institute of Chicago and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, he will be. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Spirituality for the Skeptic: The Thoughtful Love of Life</h2><p>Is it possible to be spiritual and yet not believe in the supernatural? Can a person be spiritual without belonging to a religious group or organization? In this book, philosopher Robert Solomon offers challenging answers to these questions as he explodes commonly held myths about what is means to be spiritual in today's pluralistic world. <br> Based on Solomon's own struggles to reconcile philosophy with religion, <em>Spirituality for the Skeptic</em> offers a model of a vibrant, fulfilling spirituality that embraces the complexities of human existence and acknowledges the joys and tragedies of life. Solomon has forged an enlightened new path that synthesizes spirituality with emotions, intellect, science, and common sense. His new paradigm, "naturalized" spirituality, establishes as its cornerstone the "thoughtful love of life"--a passionate concern for the here-and-now, and not the by-and-by. Being spiritual doesn't mean being holed up as a recluse, spending hours in meditation and contemplation, Solomon argues. It demands involvement and emotional engagement with others in the struggle to find meaning in our lives. As such, this modern-day spirituality encompasses a passionate enthusiasm for the world, the transformation of self, cosmic trust and rationality, coming to terms with fate, and viewing life as a gift, all of which are explored in depth throughout this book.<br> <em>Spirituality for the Skeptic</em> answers the need for a non-institutional, non-dogmatic spirituality that leads to personal fulfillment and satisfaction. By examining the ideas of great thinkers from Socrates and Nietzsche to Buddha to Kafka, Solomon arrives at a practical vision of spirituality that should appeal to many seekers looking to make sense of the human condition.<br></p><p><br><strong>Robert C. Solomon</strong> is the Quincy Lee Centennial Professor of Business and Philosophy and Distinguished Teaching Professor at the University of Texas, Austin. His books include <em>A Short History of Philosophy, A Passion for Wisdom</em>, and <em>The Joy of Philosophy</em>, all published by Oxford.<br>Solomon (business and philosophy, Univ. of Texas, Austin; A Passion for Wisdom) has no sympathy for New Age spirituality or any family heritage of traditional religious practice. Nevertheless, he has also grown weary of academic philosophy's tendency toward "clever paradox and puzzle-solving" and "often cynical obscurantism." "Philosophy," he reminds us, "is a spiritual practice." He looks to philosophy itself, especially the work of Hegel and Nietzsche, to provide the tools to pursue a naturalized spirituality, spirituality as "the thoughtful love of life." Separate chapters address thoughtful spirituality as characterized by passion, cosmic trust, and rationality; as facing up to tragedy, fate, and death; and as fostering transformation of the self. This is a warm and wise book. While Solomon does not begin to touch the historical riches of philosophy as spiritual practice (as in the pioneering work of Pierre Hadot), he does begin the important task of reconceiving contemporary philosophy as a passionate spirituality a spirituality for those skeptical of supernaturalism and authority-based religious claims.

Now that social theory is practiced in many disciplines, it is necessary to reflect on the variety of theories being read today and the earlier sources that are customarily neglected. If today we read Donna Haraway, Henry Louis Gates, and Michel Foucault, we should also read and understand Charlotte Perkins Gilman and W.E.B. Du Bois, alongside Max Weber, Georg Simmel, William James, and others from the end of the nineteenth century. This book, therefore, sets a wider gauge for the understanding of the history of social thought than could have been possible before. It brings together theories in unexpected and exciting ways: those of Talcott Parsons and Dorothy Smith, Robert K. Merton and Jacques Lacan, Immanuel Wallerstein and Frantz Fanon, James Coleman and Molefi Asante. Extensive introductory essays by the editor situate the readings in their historical place and time, identifying the currents of social change that shaped fundamental questions of modern and postmodern life.

In this eloquent and insightful book, an eminent critic explores the reasons behind the enduring power of Chekhov's works.<br><br>Richard Gilman examines each of Chekhov's full-length plays, showing how they relate to each other, to Chekhov's short stories, and to his life. He also places the plays in the context of Russian and European drama and the larger culture of the period. Gilman interweaves biographical narrative with textual commentary and with a discussion of stagecraft and dramaturgy&#x2015;Chekhov's techniques for influencing viewers, the scenic framing of the action, and issues of genre and temporal structuring. Although previous critics of Chekhov have tended to view him as an essentially social dramatist or as an observer of the smaller aspects of existence, Gilman asserts that Chekhov was far more of an innovative playwright, a revolutionary, than has been seen. His book&#x2015;the most complete, acute, and elegant study of this master playwright ever written&#x2015;will appeal to all those who care about Chekhov, theater, and the life of the mind.</p><p>Richard Gilman is professor of playwriting and dramatic literature at Yale University&#39;s School of Drama.In a highly impressive if occasionally meandering series of essays, Yale drama professor Gilman (The Making of Modern Drama) presents an extended look at the dramatic methods employed by Chekhov in each of his plays. Often drawing on Chekhov's letters and fiction, Gilman argues against both the Soviet school of criticism, which perceived Chekhov as writing political drama about the sterility of middle-class lives, and also against those critics who saw his plays as plotless excercises in Naturalism. Instead Gilman argues that Chekhov was a theatrical revolutionary, a deliberately anti-dramatic writer in whose plays events that don't happen are often more important than those that do, and whose disjointed and often digressive dialogue allowed him to write in a musical and allusive rather than mechanical and melodramatic way. Gilman sees in Chekhov a precursor of Samuel Beckett, although Chekhov's objectivity and emotional restraint kept his plays more balanced and less despairing than Beckett's. The case Gilman makes for his subject's formal radicalism and literary stature is convincing as well as free from academic cant. Though he has a tendency to ramble, Gilman's encyclopedic knowledge of all things Chekhovian makes for interesting digressions, and this work should be eagerly received not only by admirers of Chekhov but by serious devotees of the theater. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Fate of Reason: German Philosophy from Kant to Fichte</h2><p><p><i>The Fate of Reason</i> is the first general history devoted to the period between Kant and Fichte, one of the most revolutionary and fertile in modern philosophy.

These as yet undetected fluctuations in the shape of space-time were first predicted by Einstein's general theory of relativity, but only now, at the dawn of the twenty-first century, are we on the brink of finally observing them.</p><br><p> Daniel Kennefick's landmark book takes readers through the theoretical controversies and thorny debates that raged around the subject of gravitational waves after the publication of Einstein's theory. The previously untold story of how we arrived at a settled theory of gravitational waves includes a stellar cast from the front ranks of twentieth-century physics, including Richard Feynman, Hermann Bondi, John Wheeler, Kip Thorne, and Einstein himself, who on two occasions avowed that gravitational waves do not exist, changing his mind both times.</p><br><p> The book derives its title from a famously skeptical comment made by Arthur Stanley Eddington in 1922--namely, that "gravitational waves propagate at the speed of thought." Kennefick uses the title metaphorically to contrast the individual brilliance of each of the physicists grappling with gravitational-wave theory against the frustratingly slow progression of the field as a whole.</p><br><p> Accessibly written and impeccably researched, this book sheds new light on the trials and conflicts that have led to the extraordinary position in which we find ourselves today--poised to bring the story of gravitational waves full circle by directly confirming their existence for the very first time.</p></p><p><p>"This book is a very impressive achievement. Kennefick skillfully introduces readers to some of the most abstruse yet fascinating concepts in modern physics stemming from Einstein's gravitational theory. And he charts the often haphazard, meandering, at times contentious development of these ideas over the course of nearly a century. More than an intellectual history, this book is a kind of detective story. Amid unfolding clues, partial insights, evolving institutions, the play of personalities, and hard thinking, the reader is treated to larger lessons about how theoretical physics works. Until now, we had virtually no serious study of what happened to Einstein's general relativity after he published his famous equations. Kennefick is among the first to begin to fill in this story."<b>--David Kaiser, author of <i>Drawing Theories Apart: The Dispersion of Feynman Diagrams in Postwar Physics</i></b></p><p>"In this book, Kennefick describes a seventy-year quest, by three generations of physicists, to discover relativity's predictions about gravitational waves. Combining his skills as a historian with his mastery of relativity and his powers as a storyteller, he weaves a compelling narrative of intellectual battles and mathematical struggles--and extracts fascinating insights about the roles of mathematics, intuition, analogy, and style, standards of proof, and the sociology of competing schools."<b>--Kip S. Thorne, California Institute of Technology</b></p><p>"This book is a very important contribution both to Einstein studies and to the history of physics in general. It is also very timely given the effort underway to detect gravitational waves. The author is in an absolutely unique position to tell this story. He is extremely well connected to the community of Einstein scholars, to the community of physicists past and present working on gravitational waves, and to the group of people working on the history of the subject."<b>--Michel Janssen, University of Minnesota</b></p><b>Daniel Kennefick</b> is Visiting Assistant Professor of Physics at the University of Arkansas.

The bloody oligarchic dictatorship of the Thirty is over, and the democrats have returned to the city victorious. Renouncing vengeance, in an act of willful amnesia, citizens call for&#x2015;-if not invent&#x2015;-amnesty. They agree to forget the unforgettable, the "past misfortunes," of civil strife or stasis. More precisely, what they agree to deny is that stasis&#x2015;-simultaneously partisanship, faction, and sedition&#x2015;-is at the heart of their politics. Continuing a criticism of Athenian ideology begun in her pathbreaking study The Invention of Athens, Nicole Loraux argues that this crucial moment of Athenian political history must be interpreted as constitutive of politics and political life and not as a threat to it. Divided from within, the city is formed by that which it refuses. Conflict, the calamity of civil war, is the other, dark side of the beautiful unitary city of Athens. In a brilliant analysis of the Greek word for voting, diaphora, Loraux underscores the conflictual and dynamic motion of democratic life. Voting appears as the process of dividing up, of disagreement&#x2015;-in short, of agreeing to divide and choose. Not only does Loraux reconceptualize the definition of ancient Greek democracy, she also allows the contemporary reader to rethink the functioning of modern democracy in its critical moments of internal stasis.</p></p><p>Nicole Loraux (1943-2003) was the author of <i>The Divided City</i>, <i>The Children of Athena</i>, <i>The Experiences of Tiresias</i>, <i>Tragic Ways of Killing a Woman</i>, and <i>Mothers in Mourning</i>, among other titles.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Art and the creative consciousness</h2><p>Product Details Hardcover: 208 pages Publisher: Prentice Hall (February 1973) Language: English</p><p></p><h2>Look Great, Feel Great: 12 Keys to Enjoying a Healthy Life Now</h2><p>Bestselling author Joyce Meyer shares her own struggle to overcome unhealthy living habits, as well as the keys for restoring mental, physical, and spiritual wellness.</p><p>AUTHORBIO: Joyce Meyer lives in St. Louis, Missouri.It's okay to be fit and take care of your appearance, says the TV evangelist in a soft and intimate audio. Though she never leaves her Christian moorings, Meyer pushes the culture's boundaries between mind and body by reminding people that stress, neglecting oneself, and negative attitudes can be devastating to one's health over time. Though this advice is standard fare in the personal growth genre, it might lighten up people who push themselves to help others, or who never think that attending to their own needs is part of God's plan.

The character of concrete is largely the product of the rigid moulds that have shaped it since its invention in antiquity. The advent of flexible moulds, however, marks a radical break from conventional practice &#x2013; and conventional concrete architecture. <i>The Fabric Formwork Book</i> provides the first comprehensive handbook on the emerging technology of flexible moulds for reinforced concrete architecture.</p> <p></p> <p>Written by the foremost expert in the field, this book takes a comprehensive and generous approach that includes technical, historical and theoretical aspects of the subject. The book:</p> <p></p> <ul> <p> </p><li>concentrates on simple flat-sheet formworks</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>contains detailed technical descriptions of how to construct a wide range of formworks for various applications</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>features case studies from around the world</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>critiques the difficulties and advantages in each case it covers </li> <li>provides instruction and guidance on how to model and design fabric-formed structures</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>includes the most comprehensive history of fabric formwork yet published</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>features essays from guest expert authors, which explore the theoretical, historical, and poetic significance of flexibly formed architecture and structures</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>discusses fabric formwork as an exemplary approach to sustainable construction through its simplicity and efficiency.</li> <p></p></ul> <p></p> <p>Beautifully designed and illustrated with a superb range of images, diagrams and technical drawings, the book both informs and inspires. Speaking directly and plainly to professionals, students and academics, the language used is both clear and precise, and care is taken to avoid opaque technical or academic jargon. Technical terms, when used, are clearly described and a special glossary is included to make the book as widely accessible as possible.</p></p><p><p><strong>Mark West</strong> is an artist, builder, professor of architecture, and inventor of numerous flexible mould techniques for concrete construction.

Beginning with the work and insights of the early immunologists in the 18th century, Silverstein traces the development of the major ideas which have formed immunology down to the maturation of the discipline in the decade following the Second World War. Emphasis is placed on the philosophic and sociologic climate of the scientific milieu in which immunology has developed, providing a background to the broad culture of the discipline.<ul><li>A professional-level intellectual history of the development of immunology from about 1720 to 1970, with emphasis placed on the social climate of the scientific milieu in which modern immunology evolved</li><li>Written by an author very well known both as a historian of medical science and for his substantial research contributions to the immunopathology of the eye</li><li>The only complete history of immunology available</li></ul></p><p>In this innovative, short, new textbook, Rod Langman offers a conceptual framework within which students can understand the evolution of the immune system. Evolutionary selection for resistance to infectious disease is shown to be the driving force that has shaped the immune system into a remarkably effective and efficient system of defense. In the midst of the current information explosion in immunological science, when many students are under the impression that the immune system is almost too complex to understand as a whole, <i>The Immune System</i> can be used alone as a text for an introductory course or used in conjunction with any of the several descriptive texts already on the market. Alone or in conjunction, it offers students a whole new higher level of understanding.<p>"Energetic and overwhelmingly successful...

This selection of writings, taken from different phases of Towne&#39;s professional and personal life, reflects that diversity. Readers will discover brilliant and insightful essays on such wide ranging fields as maser and laser technology, quantum electronics, microwave spectroscopy, and molecules in interstellar space, along with thought-provoking spiritual views on how science and religion come together.</p><p>From one of the most imaginative and daring scientific minds of this or any century comes a thoughtful, almost intimate account of a personal journey through his momentous discoveries - achievements that have changed the face of medicine, industry, even weapons. Nobel laureate Charles H. Townes, inventor of the maser and co-inventor, with Arthur Schawlow, of the laser, takes us on a behind-the-scenes tour of his unique - and startlingly productive and creative - way of working. Along the way, you&#39;ll learn about how Townes came upon his surprising findings and how he managed to avoid obstacles in his path. Townes introduces us to the wonders of the universe, from the submicroscopic, most minute - the workings of atoms and the even smaller particles that make them up - to the vast outer reaches of space. His tour takes us along paths Townes pioneered: quantum electronics, microwave spectroscopy and the frontiers of our galaxy where he explored the dark, rarefied clouds of gas and dust where new stars form. Recognizing that some of the most revolutionary recent scientific theories about how the universe emerged come close to religious thought, these accessible essays conclude with a uniquely personal coda in which Townes suggests that science and religion occupy the same terrain.Charles H.

And what happens when an American Jew, raised by a secular family, falls in love with Berlin not <i>in spite</i> of his being a Jew but <i>because</i> of it?&nbsp; The answer is <i>Berlin for Jews</i>. Part history and part travel companion, <b>Leonard Barkan&#x2019;s</b> personal love letter to the city shows how its long Jewish heritage, despite the atrocities of the Nazi era, has left an inspiring imprint on the vibrant metropolis of today.&nbsp;<br><br> Barkan, voraciously curious and witty, offers a self-deprecating guide to the history of Jewish life in Berlin, revealing how, beginning in the early nineteenth century, Jews became prominent in the arts, the sciences, and the city&#x2019;s public life.

Beautifully observed, deftly rendering the civilities and constraints of a vanished era, the novel measures the subterranean currents of love and need that run all our lives.</p><p>In the Morison house the important goes unsaid and indirection is the operative mode--conversation stops where it should start and key terms such as fear, pain, pregnancy, fail to be addressed. The younger son, an eight-year-old, passes his days deciphering adults' inaccessible discussions. "In this fashion they communicated with each other, out of knowledge and experience inaccessible to Bunny. By nods and silences. By a tired curve of his mother's mouth. By his father's measuring glance over the top of his spectacles." Bunny's older brother would rather escape to the outside world, and their father finds declaiming the day's headlines--World War I's end and the onslaught of Spanish Influenza--far preferable to engagement. Only Elizabeth, their mother, is capable of holding the family together. The fifth main character in <i>They Came Like Swallows</i> is the house itself. Maxwell expresses the boys' reactions through this labile, interior landscape. Bunny finds the dining room can be "braced and ready for excitement"; later his brother realizes "for the first time how still the house was, how full of waiting, ... tense and expectant." Though war never makes it to Illinois, the flu changes all. First Bunny is stricken, and once he recovers Elizabeth, pregnant, dies from it. In quiet, piercing prose, William Maxwell's second novel, originally published in 1937, evokes the greatest of losses and the terrors of imagination.hed in 1937, They Came Like Swallows was William Maxwell's second novel. It tells of an ordinary American family overtaken by the devastating epidemic of the Spanish influenza of 1918. The book begins on the day before the armistice in <br>a small midwestern town, and the events are seen from the perspective, in turn, of eight-year-old Peter Morison--called Bunny; of his older brother, Robert; and of their father. They are witnesses to a domestic tragedy that is written with beauty and a quite magnificent tenderness.<br>William Maxwell has been described by The Washington Post as "one of America's most distinguished and distinctive stylists." John Updike has said that "Maxwell's voice is one of the wisest in American fiction; it <br>is, as well, one of the kindest."

Absolutely gripping and compulsively readable, <i>Booklist</i> said this book, "does what good historical fiction is supposed to do: put a face on history that is recognizable to all." And medieval expert Tom Shippey, writing for the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> said, "Sagas look like novels superficially, in their size and layout and plain language, but making their narratives into novels is a trick which has proved beyond most who have tried it. Janoda's <i>Saga</i> provides a model of how to do it: pick out the hidden currents, imagine how they would seem to peripheral characters, and as with all historical novels, load the narrative with period detail drawn from the scholars. No better saga adaptation has been yet written."</p><p>Jeff Janoda brings us a masterful retelling of the ancient <i>Saga of the People of Eyri</i>, set in feudal Iceland, "the Free State" of 965 AD. <i>Saga</i> tells the story of savage rituals of feud and sacrifice brought by settlers from Norway, and their new competing beliefs in a democratic legal assembly and a code of restraint.<br><br>When Thorolf the Viking trades away his valuable lands to spite his son Arnkel, the ruthless Norse chieftain vows to regain the land at all costs. Robbed of his rightful inheritance, Arnkel begins a venomous feud with his neighbors and with rival chieftain Snorri - a lawless dispute destined to end in betrayal and death.<br><br>Janoda's characters are eloquently wrought, their passions and pagan beliefs brought to life in a tale over a thousand years old. He renders fantastical elements like spirits and elves as vividly as their human counterparts, illuminating the harshness of life in a society on the brink of modernity, yet isoalted in the farthest reaches of the planet.&#34;As focused as Jane Austen, as macabre as Stephen King, Jeff Janoda traces out the hidden springs of power in the micro-society of an Icelandic fjord. He tells a tale of complex feud with all the fullness and detail of a modern novel, but leaves its violent and treacherous heroes as enigmatic as before. A brilliant blend of scholarship and insight.&#34; --Dr. Tom Shippey, author of THE ROAD TO MIDDLE EARTH</p><h2>Biting the Hands that Feed Us: How Fewer, Smarter Laws Would Make Our Food System More Sustainable</h2><p><p>Food waste, hunger, inhumane livestock conditions, disappearing fish stocks&#x2014;these are exactly the kind of issues we expect food regulations to combat. Yet, today in the United States, laws exist at all levels of government that actually make these problems worse. Baylen Linnekin argues that, too often, government rules handcuff America&#x2019;s most sustainable farmers, producers, sellers, and consumers, while rewarding those whose practices are anything but sustainable.<br><br><i>Biting the Hands that Feed Us</i> introduces readers to the perverse consequences of many food rules. Some of these rules constrain the sale of &#x201c;ugly&#x201d; fruits and vegetables, relegating bushels of tasty but misshapen carrots and strawberries to food waste. Other rules have threatened to treat manure&#x2014;the lifeblood of organic fertilization&#x2014;as a toxin. Still other rules prevent sharing food with the homeless and others in need. There are even rules that prohibit people from growing fruits and vegetables in their own yards.<br><br> Linnekin also explores what makes for a good food law&#x2014;often, he explains, these emphasize good outcomes rather than rigid processes. But he urges readers to be wary of efforts to regulate our way to a greener food system, calling instead for empowerment of those working to feed us&#x2014;and themselves&#x2014;sustainably.&nbsp;</p></p><p>An exploration of U.S. food policy that reveals the unexpected ways regulations can thwart sustainable practices.&nbsp;<p>Baylen J.

For decades, people have been studying Shakespeare&#39;s life and times, and in recent years there has been a renewed surge of interest into aspects of his language. So how can we better understand Shakespeare? How did he manipulate language to produce such an unrivaled body of work, which has enthralled generations both as theater and as literature? David Crystal addresses these and many other questions in this lively and original introduction to Shakespeare&#39;s language. Covering in turn the five main dimensions of language structure - writing system, pronunciation, grammar, vocabulary, and conversational style - the book shows how examining these linguistic &#39;nuts and bolts&#39; can help us achieve a greater appreciation of Shakespeare&#39;s linguistic creativity.</p><p>For decades, people have been studying Shakespeare&#39;s life and times, and in recent years there has been a renewed surge of interest into aspects of his language.

The disasters they endured form a bold contrast to the comfort and safety of the present-day Donner Lake region.<br>Mr. McGlashan was a contemporary of the Donner Party's children.

But as Michael Chabon's marvelous introduction reminds us, the ghost story was once integral to the genre of the short story. Indeed, as he points out, it can be argued that the ghost story was the genre. Dickens's "A Christmas Carol," Henry James's "The Turn of the Screw"--most of the early short story writers wrote ghost stories as a matter of course. And the best writer of ghost stories, the acknowledged master, was M.R. James. <br> In <em>Casting the Runes</em>, we have twenty-one tales that, in Chabon's words, "venture to the limits of the human capacity for terror and revulsion...armed only with an umbrella and a very dry wit." The stories here represent the best of James's work. They are set in the leisurely, late-Victorian, middle-class world of country houses, seaside inns, out-of-the-way railway stations, and cathedral closes, where gentlemen of independent means and antiquarian tastes suddenly find themselves confronted by terrifying agents of supernatural malice. But what these tales are really about, writes Chabon, "is ultimately the breathtaking fragility of life, of 'reality,' of all the structures that we have erected to defend ourselves from our constant nagging suspicion that underlying everything is chaos, brutal and unreasoning."<br> The tales in <em>Casting the Runes</em> are both chilling fun and, as Chabon concludes, "unmistakably works of art." Anyone who loves short fiction or who enjoys a good scare will find these stories an irresistible delight.</p><p><br><strong>M.R. James</strong> was one of the most accomplished scholars of his generation, a brilliant, internationally known authority on early Christian manuscripts. He was in turn a Fellow, Dean, and Provost of Kings College, Cambridge, and then finally the Provost of Eton, where he died a much-loved and revered figure in 1936. <br><strong>Michael Chabon</strong> is the author of <em>Wonder Boys, The Mysteries of Pittsburgh</em>, and <em>The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay</em>, which won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction.<br><br>"A must read for the true-blue aficionado.... James is best known now for his supernatural stories, regarded by many as being among the best ever written."--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The House of the Seven Gables (Enriched Classics)</h2><p><b>Enduring Literature Illuminated By Practical Scholarship</b> <br><br> The story of the Pyncheon family, residents of an evil house cursed by the victim of their ancestor's witch hunt and haunted by the ghosts of many generations. <br><br> <b>This Enriched Classic Edition Includes:</b> <br> <br> <ul> <li>A concise introduction that gives the reader important background information</li><br> <li>A chronology of the author's life and work</li><br> <li>A timeline of significant events that provides the book's historical context</li><br> <li>An outline of key themes and plot points to guide the reader's own interpretations</li><br> <li>Detailed explanatory notes</li><br> <li>Critical analysis, including contemporary and modern perspectives on the work</li><br> <li>Discussion questions to promote lively classroom and book group interaction</li><br> <li> A list of recommended related books and films to broaden the reader's experience</li> </ul> <br><br> Enriched Classics offer readers affordable editions of great works of literature enhanced by helpful notes and insightful commentary.

The cutting edge of anthropological research today is a product of earlier questions and answers, previous ambitions, preoccupations and adventures, stretching back one hundred years or more. This book is the first comprehensive history of American anthropology. Crucially, Patterson relates the development of anthropology in the United States to wider historical currents in society. American anthropologists over the years have worked through shifting social and economic conditions, changes in institutional organization, developing class structures, world politics, and conflicts both at home and abroad. How has anthropology been linked to colonial, commercial and territorial expansion in the States? How have the changing forms of race, power, ethnic identity and politics shaped the questions anthropologists ask, both past and present? Anthropology as a discipline has always developed in a close relationship with other social sciences,but this relationship has rarely been scrutinized. This book details and explains the complex interplay of forces and conditions that have made anthropology in America what it is today. Furthermore, it explores how anthropologists themselves have contributed and propagated powerful images and ideas about the different cultures and societies that make up our world.This book will be essential reading for anyone interested inunderstanding the roots and reasons behind American anthropology at the turn of the twenty-first century. Intellectual historians, social scientists, and anyone intrigued by the growth and development of institutional politics and practices should read this book.</p><p>Thomas C. Patterson Professor and Chair of Anthropology,University of California at Riverside<p>&#x201c;Tom Patterson has written a trail-blazing social and institutional history of American anthropology. He has demonstrated not only the impact that American Society has had on anthropology but also the significant impact that anthropology has had on American society. His book is a powerful wake-up call for American anthropologists to stop playing second-fiddle to cultural studies and resume their multifaceted dialogue with the American people.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Bruce Trigger, McGill University</i></p><p>&#x201c;Patterson has given us a fine and politically informed history of American Anthropology that engages the big issues of American history. Why are some research questions important to US scholars and others are not? How have the nation's ideological and social projects shaped anthropologists' scholarly agendas? And, conversely, how have anthropologists across the political spectrum helped shape intellectual and political debates of national importance? Patterson's thoughtful and concise answers to these questions add an important perspective to the history of anthropology.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Karen Brodkin, UCLA</i></p><p>&#x201c;From the new republic to the new economy, Tom Patterson provides a detailed and smart history of the social and political contours that have shaped the methods, theory, and anthropologists who have created and recreated the discipline in the United States. The first monograph-length history of anthropology in a generation, Patterson has written the only history of anthropology that looks beyond the academy to document the twists and turns of the political, ethical, and social issues that have and continue to impact U.S. anthropology. Beautifully written, sprightly argued, and very informative, Patterson has written a critical text that will change the way we think about and interpret the history of anthropology.&#x201d; &#x2015;Lee D.Baker, Duke University</p><p>&#x201c;This is an important book. It does much to re-articulate anthropological developments within the political-economic matrix that birthed them. Patterson brings long-ignored political forces to the fore, the end result being a new focus on factors overlooked by other disciplinary histories.

However, the story central to the crisis-that of AIG-has until now remained largely untold. <i>Fatal Risk: A Cautionary Tale of AIG's Corporate Suicide</i> tells the inside story of what really went on inside AIG that caused it to choke on risk and nearly brining down the entire economic system. The book<br> </p> <ul> <li>Reveals inside information available nowhere else, including the personal notes and records of key players such as the former Chairman of AIG, Hank Greenberg</li> <li>Takes readers behind the scenes at the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York</li> <li>Details how an understanding of risk built AIG, but a disdain for government regulators led to a run-in with New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer</li> </ul> <p><i>Fatal Risk</i> is the comprehensive and compelling true story of the company at the center of the financial storm and how it nearly caused the entire economic system to collapse.</p></p><p>"As author of <i>Fatal Risk</i> . . . I would have found my job much easier if Goldman truly were the real culprit in this saga."<br> [from "AIG and Goldman Sachs: The Deceptive Blame Game," appearing on TheFinancialInvestigator.com, July 2010] <p>There certainly has been no dearth of reporting on the causes of the 2008 financial meltdown. Thousands of gallons of ink have been spilled decrying the gross incompetence, if not downright criminality, of mortgage lenders, the wildly excessive risk-taking of Wall Street banks, the cravenness and collusion of the ratings agencies, and the willful ignorance of regulators. Yet absent from the orgy of righteous finger-pointing has been any substantive coverage of AIG, the looming giant in the eye of the tempest&#x2014;the one company about which it can truly be said that, if it had been allowed to collapse, it would have dragged the entire world financial system down with it.</p> <p><i>Fatal Risk</i> is the riveting inside account of how Maurice "Hank" Greenberg, the storied combat veteran and driven entrepreneur, took a motley collection of insurance companies and built them into the world's most innovative and daring financial conglomerate. Made rich and powerful through Greenberg's iron will and vision, AIG was unprepared for his dramatic ouster in 2005. As the company recovered from a bruising regulatory battle, its management did not understand what risks were being taken onto its once mighty balance sheet in the name of a quick buck. As the CDO and real estate markets imploded, AIG's role as the indispensable giant at the corner of Main Street and Wall Street nearly brought down the world financial system.</p> <p>Perhaps most controversially, investigative reporter Roddy Boyd argues that, contrary to conventional wisdom, Goldman Sachs, and the billions in collateral calls it made on AIG's Financial Products unit, was not the sole cause of the company's downfall. Drawing upon a host of sources&#x2014;from Hank Greenberg to senior Goldman executives; current and former AIG leaders and board members; to legendary short-seller Jim Chanos and Federal Reserve officials&#x2014;Boyd makes a compelling case that AIG's collapse was an inside job. It took several generations of tireless work and measured risk-taking to build AIG into a AAA-rated juggernaut, but it took only a few years of profit and bonus chasing from a handful of previously unknown executives to bring the world's most important company to its knees.</p> <p>A cautionary tale of corporate hubris and the enthralling, never-before-told story of how an insurance company became a central player in the global financial meltdown, Fatal Risk is must reading for market insiders, investors, business leaders, and anyone who's wondered what really happened in 2008.</p><b>Praise for <i>Fatal Risk</i></b> <p>"Not surprisingly given his reporting chops, Roddy Boyd has written in <i>Fatal Risk</i> a seminal account of how AIG willfully&#x2014;and irresponsibly&#x2014;came to insure much of the risk in the financial world in the first decade of the twenty-first century. <i>Fatal Risk</i> is must reading for anyone who wants to be entertained and to understand."<br> &#x2014;<b>William D.

She wrote her first book, At Mrs Lippincote&#39;s, during the war, and this was followed by eleven further novels and a children&#39;s book, Mossy Trotter. Her short stories appeared in Vogue, the New Yorker and Harper&#39;s Bazaar. Rosamond Lehmann considered her writing &#39;sophisticated, sensitive and brilliantly amusing, with a kind of stripped, piercing feminine wit&#39;, and Kingsley Amis regarded her as &#39;one of the best English novelists born in this century&#39;.Wickedly satirical . . .

His real name was possibly Johannes Faust. Told in dramatic form.</p><p>This is a full cast production with sound effects and original music produced at the Canadian Broadcasting Centre. <p>Length is approximately 2 hours.</p><p>One of the most durable myths in Western culture, the story of Faust tells of a learned German doctor who sells his soul to the devil in exchange for knowledge and power. Early enactments of Faust's damnation were often the raffish fare of clowns and low comedians. But the young Elizabethan playwright Christopher Marlowe (1564&#x2013;1593) recognized in the story of Faust's temptation and fall the elements of tragedy.<br>In his epic treatment of the Faust legend, Marlowe retains much of the rich phantasmagoria of its origins. There are florid visions of an enraged Lucifer, dueling angels, the Seven Deadly Sins, Faustus tormenting the Pope, and his summoning of the spirit of Alexander the Great. But the playwright created equally powerful scenes that invest the work with tragic dignity, among them the doomed man's calling upon Christ to save him and his ultimate rejection of salvation for the embrace of Helen of Troy.</p><p></p></p><h2>Orange Empire: California and the Fruits of Eden</h2><p>This innovative history of California opens up new vistas on the interrelationship among culture, nature, and society by focusing on the state's signature export&#x2015;the orange. From the 1870s onward, California oranges were packaged in crates bearing colorful images of an Edenic landscape. This book demystifies those lush images, revealing the orange as a manufactured product of the state's orange industry. <i>Orange Empire </i>brings together for the first time the full story of the orange industry&#x2015;how growers, scientists, and workers transformed the natural and social landscape of California, turning it into a factory for the production of millions of oranges. That industry put up billboards in cities across the nation and placed enticing pictures of sun-kissed fruits into nearly every American's home. It convinced Americans that oranges could be consumed as embodiments of pure nature and talismans of good health. But, as this book shows, the tables were turned during the Great Depression when Upton Sinclair, Carey McWilliams, Dorothea Lange, and John Steinbeck made the Orange Empire into a symbol of what was wrong with America's relationship to nature.</p><p>"Douglas Sackman peels an orange and finds inside nothing less than an American agricultural-industrial culture in all its inventive, exploitative, transformative, and destructive power.

Adopting micro- and macrohistorical perspectives, Paul D. Barclay argues that the interpreters, chiefs, and trading-post operators who mediated state-society relations on Taiwan&#x2019;s &#x201c;savage border&#x201d; during successive Qing and Japanese regimes rose to prominence and faded to obscurity in concert with a series of &#x201c;long nineteenth century&#x201d; global transformations.<br> &nbsp;<br> Superior firepower and large economic reserves ultimately enabled Japanese statesmen to discard mediators on the border and sideline a cohort of indigenous headmen who played both sides of the fence to maintain their chiefly status. Even with reluctant &#x201c;allies&#x201d; marginalized, however, the colonial state lacked sufficient resources to integrate Taiwan&#x2019;s indigenes into its disciplinary apparatus. The colonial state therefore created the Indigenous Territory, which exists to this day as a legacy of Japanese imperialism, local initiatives, and the global commodification of culture.</p><p>"Paul Barclay's exploration of indigenous histories in Taiwan is sophisticated and engaging. This highly original narrative of a formative period will be of great interest to all those concerned with comparative colonial history."&#x2014;Nicholas Thomas, Professor of Historical Anthropology, University of Cambridge<br><br> "Barclay&#x2019;s work reveals how indigeneity evolved coevally with capitalist imperialism and nationalism during the last century. It is a multisided and multiscale analysis&#x2014;incorporating global, regional, and local scales&#x2014;and it is embedded in a coherent and compelling narrative. Analysts are greatly concerned about resource frontiers in today&#x2019;s world; this study furnishes them with an indispensable historical framework."&#x2014;Prasenjit Duara, Oscar Tang Professor of East Asian Studies, Duke University<br><br> "Analytically precise and theoretically ambitious, Barclay&#x2019;s wonderful new book examines the entanglements of the interstate system, indigeneity, and sovereignty through the case of Japanese-occupied Taiwan.

The letters provide valuable firsthand accounts of evolving attitudes toward the war as conveyed between battlefronts and the home front, and they also express rich details about daily life in both environments. As the men of service age from each family join the Confederate ranks and write from military camps in Virginia and the Carolinas, they describe combat in some of the war&#39;s more significant battles. Though the surviving combatants remain staunch patriots to the Southern cause until the bitter end, in their letters readers witness the waning of initial enthusiasm in the face of the realities of combat. The corresponding letters from the home front offer a more pragmatic assessment of the period and its hardships. Emblematic of the fates of many Southern families, the experiences of these representative South Carolinians are dramatically illustrated in their letters from the eve of the Civil War through its conclusion.</p><p>Civil War letters to and from Spartanburg, South Carolina, rich with details on the battlefront and home frontTom Moore Craig is a retired history teacher and school administrator, a former legislator, and an active community volunteer in his native Spartanburg County.

In <i>Perpetual Motion,</i> Michel Jeanneret argues for a sixteenth century swept up in change and fascinated by genesis and metamorphosis.</p><p>Jeanneret begins by tracing the metamorphic sensibility in sixteenth-century science and culture. Theories of creation and cosmology, of biology and geology, profoundly affected the perspectives of leading thinkers and artists on the nature of matter and form. The conception of humanity (as understood by Pico de Mirandola, Erasmus, Rabelais, and others), reflections upon history, the theory and practice of language, all led to new ideas, new genres, and a new interest in the diversity of experience. Jeanneret goes on to show that the invention of the printing press did not necessarily produce more stable literary texts than those transmitted orally or as hand-printed manuscripts&#x2015;authors incorporated ideas of transformation into the process of composing and revising and encouraged creative interpretations from their readers, translators, and imitators. Extending the argument to the visual arts, Jeanneret considers da Vinci's sketches and paintings, changing depictions of the world map, the mythological sculptures in the gardens of Prince Orsini in Bomarzo, and many other Renaissance works. More than fifty illustrations supplement his analysis.</p></p><p><p><b>Michel Jeanneret </b> is a professor of French literature at the University of Geneva.

Do we create our own destinies, or are we merely machines? Will the machines we are now making themselves have free will? These are the fundamental questions of The Quantum Brain. To answer them, psychiatrist, researcher, and critically acclaimed author Jeffrey Satinover first explores the latest discoveries in neuroscience, modern physics, and radically new kinds of computing, then shows how, together, they suggest the brain embodies and amplifies the mysterious laws of quantum physics. By its doing so, Satinover argues we are elevated above the mere learning machines modern science assumes us to be. Satinover also makes two provocative predictions: We will soon construct artificial devices as free and aware as we are; as well as begin a startling re-evaluation of just who and what we are, of our place in the universe, and perhaps even of God.</p><p>"The Quantum Brain is an adventure in the science of ideas. It is the first book on the brain that combines a grasp of the physics of the microcosm and the technologies of artificial intelligence, neural networks, and self-organizing systems, with a recognition of the transcendant properties that define the mind and differentiate it from matter. Although the subject is inherently difficult and novel, Jeffrey Satinover is an inspired guide through the fertile areas of convergence among the pivotal sciences of the age. From such insights will emerge both new technologies and new philosophies and theologies for the Twenty First Century. <br> The Quantum Brain is our book of the month for April 200" <br> --George Guilder, Editor, The Guilder Technology Report <p> "I wish I had written this visionary book." <br> --Prof. Hugo de Garis, Head, Starbrain Project, Starlab's Artificial Brain Project </p><p> "A thrilling journey through the world of brain research.

Do we create our own destinies or are we merely machines? Can we create a brain bigger than our own? To answer these and many other provocative questions, psychiatrist, researcher, and critically acclaimed author Jeffrey Satinover turns to the cutting edge of science and sees a future for and truth about ourselves that are both shocking and profound.<br> <br> First, Satinover takes us through the fascinating history of neural nets and learning machines, a history driven by battles between some of our country's greatest minds- from the flamboyant, sometimes vilified Frank Rosenblatt to the formidable, fearless Marvin Minsky. Satinover also explains how we are applying this radical computing to neuroscience in order to create artificial brains. These not only seem to mimic ours but may even surpass them.<br> <br> Then, in language no less graceful for the heft of his subject, Satinover reveals the third axis of his stunning argument: Quantum physics, the most successful theory in the history of science, allows the brain to embody and amplify the mysterious, absolute freedom that underlies all the physical world.<br> <br> As a result, Satinover argues persuasively, we are elevated above the mere learning machines modern science assumes us to be. Satinover also makes two predictions: We will soon construct artificial devices as free and aware as we are; and we will likewise soon begin a startling re-evaluation of just who and what we are, of our place in the universe, and, perhaps, even of God.<br> <br> The world of the quantum brain, long imagined, is finally coming, and Jeffrey Satinover has given us an astonishing preview.</p><h2>Chronicle of the Murdered House</h2><p><p><b>Winner of the 2017 Best Translated Book Award</b></p><p><b>Longlisted for the 2017 National Translation Award</b></p><p>"The book itself is strange&#x2015;part Faulknerian meditation on the perversities, including sexual, of degenerate country folk; part Dostoevskian examination of good and evil and God&#x2015;but in its strangeness lies its rare power, and in the sincerity and seriousness with which the essential questions are posed lies its greatness."&#x2015;Benjamin Moser, from the introduction</p><p>Long considered one of the most important works of twentieth-century Brazilian literature, <i>Chronicle of the Murdered House </i>is finally available in English.</p><p>Set in the southeastern state of Minas Gerais, the novel relates the dissolution of a once proud patriarchal family that blames its ruin on the marriage of its youngest son, Valdo, to Nina&#x2015;a vibrant, unpredictable, and incendiary young woman whose very existence seems to depend on the destruction of the household.

Reprint.</p><p><p>Selected Poems: 1931-2004</p><p>celebrates Czeslaw Milosz's lifetime of poetry. Widely regarded as one of the greatest poets of our time, Milosz is a master of expression and probing inquiry. Life opened for Czeslaw Milosz at a crossroads of civilizations in northeastern Europe. This was less a melting pot than a torrent of languages and ideas, where old folk traditions met Catholic, Protestant, Judaic, and Orthodox rites. What unfolded next around him was a century of catastrophe and madness: two world wars, revolutions, invasions, and the murder of tens of millions, all set to a cacophony of hymns, gunfire, national anthems, and dazzling lies. In the thick of this upheaval, wide awake and in awe of living, dodging shrapnel, imprisonment, and despair, Milosz tried to understand both history and the moment, with humble respect for the suffering of each individual. He read voraciously in many languages and wrote masterful poetry that, even in translation, is infused with a tireless spirit and a penetrating insight into fundamental human dilemmas and the staggering yet simple truth that "to exist on the earth is beyond any power to name." Unflinching, outspoken, timeless, and unsentimental, Milosz digs through the rubble of the past, forging a vision -- and a warning -- that encompasses both pain and joy. "His intellectual life," writes Seamus Heaney, "could be viewed as a long single combat with shape-shifting untruth."</p><p>Czeslaw Milosz was born in Szetejnie, Lithuania, in 1911. He worked with the Polish resistance movement in Warsaw during World War II and was later stationed in Paris and Washington, D.C., as a Polish cultural attach�. He defected to France in 1951, and in 1960 he accepted a position at the University of California, Berkeley. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1980, and was a member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.

Famous and beloved during her lifetime all over Latin America and in Europe, Mistral has never been known in North America as she deserves to be. The reputation of her more flamboyant and accessible friend and countryman Pablo Neruda has overshadowed hers, and she has been officially sentimentalized into a "poetess" of children and motherhood. Translations, and even selections of her work in Spanish, have tended to underplay the darkness, the strangeness, and the raging intensity of her poems of grief and pain, the yearning power of her evocations of the Chilean landscape, the stark music of her Round Dances, the visionary splendor of her Hymns of America.</p><p>During her lifetime Mistral published four books: <i>Desolation, Tenderness, Clearcut,</i> and <i>Winepress.</i> These are included in the "Complete" Nobel edition published in Madrid; the <i>Poem of Chile</i>, her last book, was printed years after her death. Le Guin includes poems from all five books in this volume, with particular emphasis on the later work. The intelligence and passion of Le Guin's selection and translation will finally allow people in the North to hear the originality, power, purity, and intransigence of this great American voice.</p><p>Le Guin has published five volumes of her own poetry, an English version of Lao Tzu's <i>Tao Te Ching</i>, and a volume of mutual translation with the Argentine poet Diana Bellessi, <i>The Twins, the Dream/Las Gemalas, El Sue�o.</i> Strongly drawn to Mistral's work as soon as she discovered it, Le Guin has been working on this translation for five years.</p></p><p>For the first time, the breadth and depth of Nobel laureate Gabriela Mistral&#x2019;s poetry is passionately translated to English by Le Guin in this landmark bilingual edition.The breadth and depth of Nobel laureate Gabriela Mistral&#39;s poetry is passionately translated to English by Le Guin in this landmark bilingual edition.</p><h2>An American in Europe: The Photography Collection of Baroness Jeane von Oppenheim from the Norton Museum of Art</h2><p>This new collection is proof that new ways of telling the history of photography still exist. Featuring a selection of works from the very personal collection of Cologne-based connoisseur Baroness Jeane von Oppenheim, An American in Europe experiences the development of photography in the 20th century not in a chronological fashion, but according to genre: from portraits, to landscapes, to architectural photography, to still lifes, to fashion and film. Oppenheim gave her outstanding collection of about 700 photographs to the Norton Museum of Art in Palm Beach in 1999. This book focuses on surprisingly atypical choices from the oeuvres of 125 seminal artists, such as Walker Evans, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Alexander Rodchenko, Albert Renger-Patzsch, and Ulrich Tillman. Over 130 images in duotone and color illustrate the aesthetic differences between various styles, genres, and authors, and show diversities and affinities among different continents, cultures and periods. This extraordinary recombination of photographs by master artists offers viewers a fresh look at the world of photography.</p><p>In 1998, the Norton Museum of Art in Palm Beach, FL, received 700 photographs from the Baroness Jeane von Oppenheim an extraordinary gift. The American-born collector's income from a 39-year marriage to Alfred von Oppenheim, now the senior member of Germany's Oppenheim banking family, lubricated her interest in 20th-century photography and led to an outstanding collection of works from 125 different photographers, among them Walker Evans, Alexander Rodchenko, Albert Renger-Patzsch, and Berenice Abbott. This volume is the formal catalog for "An American in Europe," an exhibition of what are touted to be unusual photographs from the collection. Unfortunately, this volume neutralizes any excitement or sense of the "new" that these photographs may have once held, and the book's Old World-style design dulls the impact of what should be "modern" photography. The Norton is lucky to have the baroness's contribution, but it has not succeeded in giving its catalog sufficient shine. Not recommended.

For years now the Ramsays have spent every summer in their holiday home in Scotland, and they expect these summers will go on forever; but as the First World War looms, the integrity of family and society will be fatally challenged. With a psychologically introspective mode, the use of memory, reminiscence and shifting perspectives gives the novel an intimate, poetic essence, and at the time of publication in 1927 it represented an utter rejection of Victorian and Edwardian literary values.

Noam Chomsky compares U.S. foreign policy to that of the &#34;rogue states&#34; which the United States identifies as its enemies. Ramsey Clark argues that U.S. sanctions and military actions against Iraq are indefensible, and in violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p><p>What constitutes the behavior that gets a nation labeled a "rogue state"? If, Noam Chomsky suggests, we consider a state to be acting in an "outlaw" fashion when it refuses to heed the articles and resolutions of the United Nations, then the United States is as much a "rogue state" as Saddam Hussein's Iraq--if not more. Chomsky presents a brief outline of America's attempts--once the cold war was over--to reconstruct Iraq as an enemy after years of turning a blind eye to Saddam's activities and even supplying him with aid. He also considers how the broader "war" on terrorism fits into this post-cold-war strategy. Noted commentator on Middle Eastern affairs Edward Said supplements Chomsky's argument with a consideration of the severity of U.S. sanctions against Iraq and what he views as a growing disregard for the interests of other Arab nations in the region. And Ramsey Clark offers a brief coda on the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; Chomsky himself delivers a more elaborate consideration of this theme in another book in the Open Media series, <i>The Umbrella of U.S. Power</i>. <i>--Ron Hogan</i>Noam Chomsky lives in Cambridge MA.

He made his first flight less than ten years after the Wright brothers made theirs; he made his last only four years before the Concorde took off. Born in Russia, Sergievsky learned to fly in 1912. In World War I, he became a much-decorated infantry officer and then a fighter pilot, battling the Austro-Hungarians. During the Russian Civil War that followed, he fought on three fronts against the Bolsheviks. <br><br> Coming to America in 1923, the first job he could find in New York was with a pick and shovel, digging the Holland Tunnel, but he soon joined Igor Sikorsky&#x2019;s airplane company. Over the next decade as chief test pilot for the company, he tested the Sikorsky flying boats that Pan American Airways used to establish its world-wide routes, setting seventeen world aviation records along the way.<br><br> Sergievsky also flew pioneering flights across unchartered African and Latin American jungles in the 1930s, flew with Charles Lindbergh, tested early helicopters and jets, and flew his own Grumman Mallard on charter flights until 1965. Through it all, his sense of humor remained intact, as did his passion for beautiful women.</p><p>In World War I, Boris Sergievsky won Imperial Russia&#39;s highest honor for leading his infantrymen in a charge that captured a fortified enemy hilltop. He then took to the air to become a fighter pilot and combat ace. As a test pilot, adventurer, flier for two more air forces and the pilot for explorers and prospectors in Africa and Latin America, he flew on four continents. His memoirs are edited by two writers who knew him well: his nephew, Adam Hochschild, and aviation editor Allan Forsyth.Boris in Love: "I fell in love with a Polish girl . . . Her parents were annoyed and decided to send her to the country. I went to the train to bid her goodbye but her relatives were in her compartment . . . I was standing at the end of the platform when the train started to move; as the last carriage was passing I jumped in. I saw her father and two cousins running behind the train, waving their fists and shouting unpleasant things. When I entered my sweetheart's compartment, she fainted . . . " <p> Battle in the Carpathians: "I ran faster than my soldiers and found myself alone on top of Mountain 384. Several Hungarians rushed in my direction with their bayonets pointed at me, ready to throw me down the mountain slopes. I fought them off with my sword. The real bayonet fight started then . . . " </p><p> Air Combat: "I saw the coverings on the wings ripped in many places by tracer bullets. The cockpit was also shot through in many places, splinters of wood flying around. I was shooting as best I could. All of a sudden I saw the pilot slump down on the stick, and our plane started to fall out of control . . . " </p><p> Test Pilot: "I knew that I was bettering the world's speed record by over 30 miles per hour, and I was feeling very happy. All of a sudden I saw behind my right engine a streak of solid white flame . . . " </p><p> Encounter With a Tidal Wave: "I made the landing about six miles offshore . . . As the landing was completed and the plane was slowing down, I saw in front of me a huge wave rising without the slightest warning . . . I had already lost my flying speed... [we collided] with a solid, almost vertical wall of water forty feet high. The next moment we were entirely submerged . . . "</p></p><h2>Crossing over the Line: Legislating Morality and the Mann Act (Worlds of Desire: the Chicago Series on Sexuality, Gender &amp; Culture)</h2><p><i>Crossing over the Line</i> describes the folly of the Mann Act of 1910&#x2014;a United States law which made travel from one state to another by a man and a woman with the intent of committing an immoral act a major crime. Spawned by a national wave of "white slave trade" hysteria, the Act was created by the Congress of the United States as a weapon against forced prostitution.<br><br>This book is the first history of the Mann Act's often bizarre career, from its passage to the amendment that finally laid it low. In David J. Langum's hands, the story of the Act becomes an entertaining cautionary tale about the folly of legislating private morality.<br><br>Langum recounts the colorful details of numerous court cases to show how enforcement of the Act mirrored changes in America's social attitudes. Federal prosecutors became masters in the selective use of the Act: against political opponents of the government, like Charlie Chaplin; against individuals who eluded other criminal charges, like the Capone mobster "Machine Gun" Jack McGurn; and against black men, like singer Chuck Berry and boxer Jack Johnson, who dared to consort with white women. The Act engendered a thriving blackmail industry and was used by women like Frank Lloyd Wright's wife to extort favorable divorce settlements.<br><br>"Crossing over the Line is a work of scholarship as wrought by a civil libertarian, and the text . . . sizzles with the passion of an ardent believer in real liberty under reasonable laws."&#x2014;Jonathan Kirsch, <i>Los Angeles Times<br><br></i></p><p>David J. Langum is professor of law at Cumberland School of Law of Samford University.A well-wrought cautionary tale about the dangers of trying to impose morality by law. Langum (Law/Samford Univ.; Law and Community on the Mexican California Frontier, not reviewed) traces the history of the Mann Act of 1910, which prohibited the transportation of women across state lines for ``prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose.'' Under this law, people were arrested and imprisoned or fined simply for having sex out of wedlock after crossing into another state, or for asking someone to come visit in another state for the purpose of having pre- or extramarital sex. Those convicted became federal felons who were consequently unable to vote, closed out of jobs, denied naturalization. Langum shows how the law grew out of the early 20th century's ``white slavery'' scare, a mixture of antimodernism, racism, and an all but pathological fear of sexuality, as well as a frenzied response to immigration and urbanization. The author argues convincingly that, like Prohibition, which came in 1919, the Mann Act was a classic example of the Progressive movement's social engineering propensities and notes that it did not produce the effects Progressives desired; people didn't stop having sex outside of marriage, and prostitution didn't fade away. The white slavery hysteria abated (because it never existed), but the law left in its place a new opportunity for blackmail of unsuspecting men and a potential for new kinds of prosecutorial misconduct in the service of a ``morals crusade.'' The act was instrumental in the growth of the FBI and the rise of J. Edgar Hoover, and Langum thoroughly exposes Hoover's use of it as a club to beat suspected ``radicals'' like Charlie Chaplin. A trifle repetitive in a lawyerly way, but a thorough, often wryly funny, and closely argued work of legal and social history. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In this book, Jonathan Sheehan shows how Protestant translators and scholars in the eighteenth century transformed the Bible from a book justified by theology to one justified by culture. In doing so, the Bible was made into the cornerstone of Western heritage and invested with meaning, authority, and significance even for a secular age.</p><br><br><p> <i>The Enlightenment Bible</i> offers a new history of the Bible in the century of its greatest crisis and, in turn, a new vision of this century and its effects on religion. Although the Enlightenment has long symbolized the corrosive effects of modernity on religion, Sheehan shows how the Bible survived, and even thrived in this cradle of ostensible secularization. Indeed, in eighteenth-century Protestant Europe, biblical scholarship and translation became more vigorous and culturally significant than at any time since the Reformation. From across the theological spectrum, European scholars--especially German and English--exerted tremendous energies to rejuvenate the Bible, reinterpret its meaning, and reinvest it with new authority.</p><br><p> Poets, pedagogues, philosophers, literary critics, philologists, and historians together built a post-theological Bible, a monument for a new religious era. These literati forged the Bible into a cultural text, transforming the theological core of the Judeo-Christian tradition. In the end, the Enlightenment gave the Bible the power to endure the corrosive effects of modernity, not as a theological text but as the foundation of Western culture.</p></p><p><p>"This lively, elegant and erudite book sheds new light on intellectual relations between eighteenth-century Germany and England.

While excellent technical treatises have been written about specialized fields, they provide little help for the nonspecialist; and other books, some of them semipopular in nature, give an overview of mathematics while omitting some necessary details. <i>Fundamentals of Mathematics</i> strikes a unique balance, presenting an irreproachable treatment of specialized fields and at the same time providing a very clear view of their interrelations, a feature of great value to students, instructors, and those who use mathematics in applied and scientific endeavors.

To reflect on method implies for Agamben an archaeological vigilance: a persistent form of thinking in order to expose, examine, and elaborate what is obscure, unanalyzed, even unsaid, in an author's thought. To be archaeologically vigilant, then, is to return to, even invent, a method attuned to a &#x201c;world supported by a thick weave of resemblances and sympathies, analogies and correspondences.&#x201d; Collecting a wide range of authors and topics in a slim but richly argued volume, Agamben enacts the search to create a science of signatures that exceeds the attempts of semiology and hermeneutics to determine the pure and unmarked signs that signify univocally, neutrally, and eternally. Three conceptual figures organize Agamben's argument and the advent of his new method: the paradigm, the signature, and archaeology. Each chapter is devoted to an investigation of one of these concepts and Agamben carefully constructs its genealogy transhistorically and from an interdisciplinary perspective. And at each moment of the text, Agamben pays tribute to Michel Foucault, whose methods he rethinks and effectively uses to reformulate the logic of the concepts he isolates. <i>The Signature of All Things</i> reveals once again why Agamben is one of the most innovative thinkers writing today.</p></p><p>Giorgio Agamben is one of the leading figures in Italian philosophy.

Focusing on the personal backgrounds of the guerrillas themselves and on national social conditions, the author explains why guerrillas emerged strongly in certain countries but not others. He considers, for example, under what circumstances guerrillas acquire military strength and why they do--or do not--secure substantial support from the peasantry in rural areas.</p></p><p><b>Timothy P. Wickham-Crowley</b> is Associate Professor of Sociology and Associate Director of the Center for Latin American Studies at Georgetown University."[This book] represents the first real attempt to bring together Latin American case studies and sociological theories of revolution. It provides a useful framework for students seeking to compare the Latin American guerrilla experiences.

Older adults ages 60 to 98 describe the effective strategies they used to manage their own aging process, to structure healthy lifestyles and social connections, and to intentionally direct their own productive occupations in satisfying and meaningful ways. The results of this qualitative research study have led to a grounded theory of Conditional Independence, which guides occupational therapy approaches to productive aging in practice.<br> &nbsp;<br> Authors Marilyn B.

E. B. Du Bois Reader</h2><p><em>The Oxford W.E.B. Du Bois Reader</em> encompasses the whole of Du Bois's long and multifaceted writing career, from the 1890s through the early 1960s. The volume selects key essays and longer works that portray the range of Du Bois's thought on such subjects as African American culture, the politics and sociology of American race relations, art and music, black leadership, gender and women's rights, Pan-Africanism and anti-colonialism, and Communism in the U.S. and abroad. <br>Chronologically, the volume stretches from definitive early essays such as "The Conservation of Races" to later works such as "Africa and World Peace" and "Gandhi and the American Negro." Du Bois's most famous book, <em>The Souls of Black Folk</em> (1903), and his landmark work on colonialism, <em>Darkwater</em> (1920), which contains many of his best-known shorter essays, such as "The African Roots of the War," "On Being Black," and "The Burden of Black Women," are both printed in their entirety. Key chapters drawn from full-length studies, including <em>The Philadelphia Negro</em>, <em>The Gift of Black Folk</em>, <em>Black</em> <em>Reconstruction</em>, <em>Dusk of Dawn</em>, <em>The World and Africa</em>, <em>In Battle for Peace</em>, and Du Bois's posthumous autobiography are supplemented by dozens of shorter essays covering topics in literature, education, African politics, urban studies, and American foreign policy. Individual essays and selections from longer works also illustrate Du Bois's skillful biographical studies of historical figures such as Toussaint L'Ouverture, Phillis Wheatley, Abraham Lincoln, and John Brown, as well as contemporaries like Booker T. Washington, Marcus Garvey, Kwame Nkrumah, Paul Robeson, and Joseph Stalin. Supplemented by an extensive critical introduction and headnotes to major works and topics, the<em>Oxford Reader</em> offers the most extensive compilation of Du Bois's writings now available.<br></p><p>Eric J.

Swindell, Indiana State University<br><br>"This is clearly the very best treatment of the writing of Du Bois in print.

Nabal was confident upon his wine, but in the morning his heart died within him. 164 Thou, O Lord, hast given me wormwood, and I have had some diffidence upon that; and thou hast cleared a morning to me again, and my heart is alive. David&#39;s heart smote him when he cut off the skirt from Saul; 165 and his heart smote him when he had numbered his people: 166 my heart hath struck me when I come to number my sins; but that blow is not to death, because those sins are not to death, but my heart lives in thee. But yet as long as I remain in this great hospital, this sick, this diseaseful world, as long as I Pg 75 remain in this leprous house, this flesh of mine, this heart, though thus prepared for thee, prepared by thee, will still be subject to the invasion of malign and pestilent vapours. But I have my cordials in thy promise; when I shall know the plague of my heart, and pray unto thee in thy house, 167 thou wilt preserve that heart from all mortal force of that infection; and the peace of God, which passeth all understandings shall keep my heart and mind through Christ Jesus. 168 XI. PRAYER. O eternal and most gracious God, who in thy upper house, the heavens, though there be many mansions, yet art alike and equally in every mansion; but here in thy lower house, though thou fillest all, yet art otherwise in some rooms thereof than in others; otherwise in thy church than in my chamber, and otherwise in thy sacraments than in my prayers; so though thou be always present and always working in every room of this thy house, my body, yet I humbly beseech thee to manifest always a more effectual presence in my heart than in the other offices....</p><p>John Donne (1572-1631) was a Jacobean poet and preacher, the representative of the so-called metaphysical poets of the period, though the term itself came after his death.

Both the valley and the coast would serve as settings for some of his best fiction. In 1919 he went to Stanford University, where he intermittently enrolled in literature and writing courses until he left in 1925 without taking a degree. During the next five years he supported himself as a laborer and journalist in New York City, all the time working on his first novel,&nbsp;<i>Cup of Gold</i>&nbsp;(1929).<br><br> After marriage and a move to Pacific Grove, he published two California books,&nbsp;<i>The Pastures of Heaven</i>&nbsp;(1932) and&nbsp;<i>To a God Unknown</i>&nbsp;(1933), and worked on short stories later collected in&nbsp;<i>The Long Valley</i>&nbsp;(1938). Popular success and financial security came only with&nbsp;<i>Tortilla Flat</i>&nbsp;(1935), stories about Monterey&#x2019;s paisanos. A ceaseless experimenter throughout his career, Steinbeck changed courses regularly. Three powerful novels of the late 1930s focused on the California laboring class:&nbsp;<i>In Dubious Battle</i>&nbsp;(1936),&nbsp;<i>Of Mice and Men</i>&nbsp;(1937), and the book considered by many his finest,&nbsp;<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;(1939).&nbsp;<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;won both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize in 1939.<br><br> Early in the 1940s, Steinbeck became a filmmaker with&nbsp;<i>The Forgotten Village</i>&nbsp;(1941) and a serious student of marine biology with&nbsp;<i>Sea of Cortez</i>&nbsp;(1941). He devoted his services to the war, writing Bombs Away (1942) and the controversial play-novelette&nbsp;<i>The Moon is Down</i>&nbsp;(1942).<i>Cannery Row</i>&nbsp;(1945),&nbsp;<i>The Wayward Bus</i>&nbsp;(1948), another experimental drama,&nbsp;<i>Burning Bright</i>(1950), and&nbsp;<i>The Log from the Sea of Cortez</i>&nbsp;(1951) preceded publication of the monumental&nbsp;<i>East of Eden</i>&nbsp;(1952), an ambitious saga of the Salinas Valley and his own family&#x2019;s history.<br><br> The last decades of his life were spent in New York City and Sag Harbor with his third wife, with whom he traveled widely. Later books include&nbsp;<i>Sweet Thursday</i>&nbsp;(1954),&nbsp;<i>The Short Reign of Pippin IV: A Fabrication</i>&nbsp;(1957),&nbsp;<i>Once There Was a War</i>&nbsp;(1958),&nbsp;<i>The Winter of Our Discontent&nbsp;</i>(1961),<i>Travels with Charley in Search of America</i>&nbsp;(1962),&nbsp;<i>America and Americans</i>&nbsp;(1966), and the posthumously published&nbsp;<i>Journal of a Novel: The East of Eden Letters</i>&nbsp;(1969),&nbsp;<i>Viva Zapata!</i>(1975),&nbsp;<i>The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights</i>&nbsp;(1976), and&nbsp;<i>Working Days: The Journals of The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;(1989).<br><br> Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1962, and, in 1964, he was presented with the United States Medal of Freedom by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Steinbeck died in New York in 1968. Today, more than thirty years after his death, he remains one of America's greatest writers and cultural figures.&nbsp;<br><br><b>John Seelye</b> was a graduate research professor of American literature at the University of Florida. He is the author of <i>The True Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain at the Movies, Prophetic Waters: The River in Early American Literature, Beautiful Machine: Rivers and the Early Republic, Memory's Nation: The Place of Plymouth Rock</i>, and <i>War Games: Richard Harding Davis and the New Imperialism</i>. He also served as the consulting editor for Penguin Classics in American literature.Book of four related stories by John Steinbeck, published in 1937 and expanded in 1945. The stories chronicle a young boy's maturation. In "The Gift," the best-known story, young Jody Tiflin is given a red pony by his rancher father. Under ranch hand Billy Buck's guidance, Jody learns to care for and train his pony, which he names Gabilan. Caught in an unexpected rain, Gabilan catches a cold and, despite Billy Buck's ministrations, dies. Jody watches the buzzards alight on the body of his beloved pony, and, distraught at his inability to control events, he kills one of them. The other stories in The Red Pony are "The Great Mountains," "The Promise," and "The Leader of the People," in which Jody develops empathy and also learns from his grandfather about "westering," the migration of people to new places and the urge for new experiences. -- <i>The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature</i></p><h2>Fundamentals of Nursing</h2><p><p>Learn fundamental nursing principles, concepts, and skills with ease! <b>Fundamentals of Nursing, 8th Edition</b> includes accurate, cutting-edge content, active learning strategies, and the latest evidence-based research to help you excel in your classes and prepare for success in today's competitive nursing field.

The 100th person to enter Parkside Mall will get lots of promotional gifts, and four kids from Wilson Elementary School's chess club are on hand to count up the shoppers and add the numbers together.^B Tension mounts as the numbers get closer to 100, and the unexpected winning shopper gets all the gifts.

The author guides the reader through the lives and careers of some of the most important American penmen, including Platt Rogers Spencer, the Father of American Handwriting, and Spencer&#39;s gifted student, George A. Gaskell, whose books and periodicals reached hundreds of thousands of students throughout the second half of the 1800s. Paul Melzer, the editor of this work, added more than 400 examples taken from original specimens to handsomely illustrate Henning&#39;s manuscript.</p><p>The period from 1850 to 1925 saw a flowering of American penmanship. In addition to itinerant writing masters, there were hundreds of private business schools, all of which taught penmanship (before the typewriter was invented). Periodicals such as The Western Penman were devoted to the subject, and expert calligraphers produced textbooks and copybooks for students. Even today, books on Spencerian calligraphy and on the Palmer method are being published (e.g., Michael Sull's Spencerian Script and Ornamental Penmanship). The present work details this period in history, devoting a chapter to each of seven experts (including Spencer and Palmer) and mentioning the work of 40 others. The text conveys the author's enthusiasm for the subject; Henning's father was himself once an editor of The American Penman and is one of the book's main subjects. Published posthumously (Henning died in 1996), this book was edited by rare book dealer and autograph collector Paul Melzer. The text is very readable, and the more than 450 illustrations are well chosen.

This edition includes an extensive appendix on second-order logic, a section on set theory with urlements, and a section on the logic that results when we allow models with empty domains. The text contains numerous exercises and an appendix furnishes answers to many of them.<br>Introduction to Mathematical Logic includes:<br><li>propositional logic<br></li><li>first-order logic<br></li><li>first-order number theory and the incompleteness and undecidability theorems of G�del, Rosser, Church, and Tarski<br></li><li>axiomatic set theory<br></li><li>theory of computability<br>The study of mathematical logic, axiomatic set theory, and computability theory provides an understanding of the fundamental assumptions and proof techniques that form basis of mathematics. Logic and computability theory have also become indispensable tools in theoretical computer science, including artificial intelligence.

When that need arises, my first choice of reference is always this book. It is the most concise and readable introductory text I have ever encountered and it is a rare occasion when I fail to find the background material needed to solve the problem. It is also an excellent source of problems and I have pulled the ideas for many test questions from it over the years.<br>-Charles Ashbacher<br><br>I was sufficiently fortunate to have taken Professor Emeritus Mendelson's famous logic course at Queens College, the City University of New York, just two semesters before his retirement. I was, and continue to be, astonished by Dr. Mendelson's precise yet easy style, and the beautifully efficient organization of the subjects. Everything from the expository prose to the system of notational conventions has been carefully thought through so as to make the book both very substantive and very readable. In my opinion, it's the best introduction to serious mathematical logic currently on the market, and thanks to the genius of its author, it is likely to remain so for a long time.

It includes novels, plays, short stories, and poetry, and is the first volume of the Excellence in Literature curriculum. <p> With the Introduction to Literature study guide, students study and write about the following books: </p><p> &#x2014; Short Stories by Welty, O. Henry, and others, &#x2014; Around the World in Eighty Days by Jules Verne, &#x2014; A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x2019;s Court by Mark Twain, &#x2014; Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bront�, &#x2014; Pygmalion by George Bernard Shaw, &#x2014; Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson, &#x2014; Animal Farm by George Orwell, &#x2014; The Tempest by William Shakespeare, &#x2014; Gulliver&#x2019;s Travels by Jonathan Swift. </p><p> <b>The curriculum</b> The Excellence in Literature curriculum is designed to present a feast of great ideas by immersing students in great literature. The self-directed format helps students learn to think and work like college students. Classics that have stood the test of time&#x2014;rollicking adventures, compelling plays, engaging poetry&#x2014;encourage students to enjoy literature study, rather than just endure it. </p><p> <b>How it works</b> A four-week lesson plan guides the study of each complete, unabridged classic, providing writing assignments and "context resources" &#x2014;&nbsp;background information on the author, relevant historical events, related art and music resources, etc.. To help students stay engaged, a variety of sources, voices, and formats have been carefully chosen as context resources, with links provided to those that are online. There are nine four-week modules in each study guide for one full school year of study. An optional Honors track adds additional reading and writing assignments, including a research paper and an optional CLEP exam. The text is written directly to the student, and can be used independently or in a classroom. There is no separate teacher manual; all writing assignments, context resource links, and student/teacher helps are included in the Introduction to Literature study guide. </p><p> <b>Student helps</b> &#x2014; A week-by-week assignment schedule &#x2014; Instructions and a student-written model for each type of paper assigned &#x2014; A chapter on how to read and understand challenging literature &#x2014; An overview of how to write an essay, from conception to revision &#x2014; Brief descriptions of major literary periods &#x2014; A curriculum website with supporting resources, including brief author biographies, art, music, related poetry, and writing helps. &#x2014; Built-in time for both a rough and a final draft of each month's essay &#x2014; Instructions and guidance for setting up a study area and English notebook &#x2014; Suggestions for study habits, time management, and use of the computer &#x2014; A model essay that teaches and demonstrates MLA formatting &#x2014; Glossary of literary terms </p><p> <b>Teacher helps </b> &#x2014; Week-by-week pacing chart with overview of reading and writing for the entire school year &#x2014; Instructions for evaluation &#x2014; A reproducible rubric with standards for content, style, and mechanics &#x2014; Suggestions for using in a co-op or classroom &#x2014; A year-end Student Evaluation Summary to keep with student records </p><p> Each student and teacher will need a copy of the study guide, plus a copy of each classic that is studied (short stories are found online). There are specific book editions recommended, but students who already own a different edition may use that. It is also helpful to have access to a dictionary, thesaurus, and writer's handbook. </p><p> The curriculum, developed in 2004 and now in its third edition, is designed to be flexible and easy to use for homeschoolers, parents, co-op teachers, and classroom instructors. Reading and listening to wonderful books, poetry, and plays, all at a reasonable pace, can cultivate a love of great literature, just as steady, careful practice in a variety of writing forms helps to cultivate clarity and confidence in communication skills.

Furthermore, the plight of women in the Majority World demands a Christian response, a holistic embrace of all that God calls women and men to be in his world.</p><p>The loudest voices speaking into women&#x2019;s lives in the twenty-first century thus far come from either fundamentalist Islam or radical feminism. And neither can be allowed to carry the day.&nbsp;</p><p>The Bible contains the highest possible view of women and invests women&#x2019;s lives with cosmic significance regardless of their age, stage of life, social status, or culture. Carolyn Custis James unpacks three transformative themes the Bible presents to women that raise the bar for women and calls them to join their brothers in advancing God&#x2019;s gracious kingdom on earth. These new images of what can be in Christ free women to embrace the life God gives them, no matter what happens. Carolyn encourages readers with a positive, kingdom approach to the changes, challenges, and opportunities facing women throughout the world today.</p></p><p>"Carolyn Custis James has written an unusual and compelling book, mixing her personal story with the dramatic changes in today's world and her thoughtful interpretations of the Scriptures and how women can respond with greater fervor to the Bible's call for change and betterment of the world."<br> <b>--Sheryl WuDunn, co-author of <i>Half the Sky</i></b> <br><br>"Half the Church is a significant contribution to the current public discourse of the role and responsibility of the church in responding to the suffering of millions of women and girls due to oppressive cultural and traditional norms. In her excellent book, Carolyn James reminds us of the urgent need for action in order to protect girls and women from gender-based violence and cultural practices such as trafficking, forced child-marriage, gang rapes, abduction, infanticide, and female genital mutilation."<br> <b>--Fatuma Hashi, Director, Gender and Development<br> World Vision International</b> <br><br>"Carolyn Custis James combines passion for the suffering women of our world with rigorous biblical observation and exegesis. The result is a prophetic word that challenges both our apathy and ignorance in the face of terrifying facts, and our theological shallowness in the face of abundant biblical teaching. The title and subtitle only tell half the story. For this is a book for the whole church and urges us to see God's global vision for men and women. Half the church badly needs to think again about the message of this book. So does the other half. Otherwise both halves are the tragic losers."<br> <br> <strong>--Christopher J. H. Wright, International Director <br> The Langham Partnership International</strong><br><br>"With the care of an experienced scout, Carolyn James has lined the fire pit with stones, then assembled the kindling and logs, and in the final chapters of this remarkable book has struck the match to ignite a blaze for God and his kingdom. No thoughtful Christian woman can walk away from this book unchallenged or unmoved, as she senses the glory of her <i>ezer</i>-warrior calling. Nor can any thoughtful Christian man remain unmoved by the vision of the Blessed Alliance so skillfully sketched in these pages. The challenge of <i>Half the Church</i> is to the whole church to fulfill God's purpose in creating all of us as iconoclastic bearers of the divine image in a broken world."<br> <b>--Alice Mathews, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary</b> <br><br> "Carolyn Custis James expertly weaves contemporary reality with biblical story. Reaching into the Old Testament as well as the New, Carolyn shows that God has always been and continues to be at work through women and girls. They are, like men and boys, His image bearers. This book should open the eyes of everyone who takes Jesus seriously to the horrendous injustices against women around the world and provoke within us a serious drive to do something about it. The day is near (and I believe this book will help usher it in) when the church will be a significant cultural catalyst for bringing equality and dignity to women and girls around the world by providing education, empowering women with microloans, and liberating them from oppressive regimes, sex trafficking circles, and secular philosophies that are ultimately degrading to them. It is time for the other half of the church, men, to be strong and courageous and do all we can with all we have to bring divine freedom to women and girls so they can be all that God created them to be."<br><br> <b>--Mark L. Russell, coauthor, <i>Routes and Radishes</i></b> <br><br> "Once again Carolyn Custis James calls us to radical thinking and living. Half the Church opens our eyes to the global problems facing women, drives us to God as the only solution, and refreshes our passion that we can 'do something.' And the writer in me loves Carolyn's exquisite phrases and vibrant images. This book is a must-read and I will be giving it to many people."<br> <strong>--Judy Douglass, Director of Women's Resources<br> Campus Crusade<br> </strong><br> "With hope, beauty, and clarity of vision, Carolyn Custis James takes a megaphone to the biblical call to mobilize justice on behalf of those who suffer violent injustice in our world today. She argues that all in the Body of Christ are God's image bearers, called to be used by God in restoring His image in those who have been most deeply stripped of the freedom and dignity intended for them. We are more aware of the scope of violent injustice in our world today than in any other time of human history; brutal abuse is committed against our neighbors-- neighbors next door and neighbors across the globe. Carolyn calls the whole Church to see the opportunity at hand--to rise up, together, and make God's justice and restoration known."<br> <strong>--Bethany H. Hoang, Director of the IJM Institute<br> INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE MISSION</strong><br> <br>"In Half the Church, Carolyn Custis James offers a striking theology as to why men and women are called to live and lead together. Her insightful, integrated and unapologetic plea leaves us with no option but to get on with it ... all of us ... men and women together urgently working for God's best in this world." <br> <strong>--Elisa Morgan, author, speaker, and publisher of FullFill</strong><p>Carolyn Custis James (MA, Biblical Studies) travels extensively as a popular speaker for women's conferences, churches, colleges, seminaries, and other Christian organizations.

Taylor's previous writing will immediately recognize <i>Altarity</i> as a remarkable synthetic project. This work combines the analytic depth and detail of Taylor's earlier studies of Kierkegaard and Hegel with the philosophical and theological scope of his highly acclaimed <i>Erring</i>.<br> <br> In <i>Altarity</i>, Taylor develops a genealogy of otherness and difference that is based on the principle of creative juxtaposition. Rather than relying on a historical or chronological survey of crucial moments in modern philosophical thinking, he explores the complex question of difference through the strategies of contrast, resonance, and design. Taylor brings together the work of thinkers as diverse as Hegel, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Lacan, Bataille, Kristeva, Levinas, Blanchot, Derrida, and Kierkegaard to fashion a broad intellectual scheme.<br> Situated in an interdisciplinary discourse, <i>Altarity</i> signifies a harnessing of continental and American habits of intellectual thought and illustrates the singularity that emerges from such a configuration. As such, the book functions as a mirror of our intellectual moment and offers the academy a rigorous way of acknowledging the limitations of its own interpretive practices.<br></p></p><p>The history of society and culture is, in large measure, a history of the struggle with the endlessly complex problems of difference and otherness.

One of the four Hungarian geniuses who would help introduce the Atomic Age at Los Alamos (the others were Edward Teller, Leo Szilard, and Eugene Wigner), von Neumann made his mark in Europe while barely past his teens through his contributions to a mathematical foundation for the new quantum physics. In 1930, the young, newly married mathematician emigrated to America to teach at Princeton. While von Neumann moved on in succeeding years to increasingly influential posts at the Institute for Advanced Study, the Los Alamos atom-bomb project, Teller's hydrogen-bomb program, and, finally, the freshly created Atomic Energy Commission, his agile and highly logical mind left an indelible mark on the computer revolution, games theory, economics, and, as his political clout increased, international relations. Despite the fact that the general reader is as likely to be interested in the development of von Neumann's hawkish political stance (particularly regarding the nuclear-arms race), and his odd fascination with such topics as global government and control of the weather, as in his scientific contributions, Macrae veers away from serious exploration of his subject's philosophical outlook--instead emphasizing (and applauding) the ease with which ``our Johnny'' used dirty jokes to evade emotional political debate, and ridiculing those of differing political temperament (e.g., deeming ``Bertie'' Russell and Norbert Wiener ``geniuses turned emotionally too dotty''). The effect is off-putting, and though ``Johnny's'' romp through world affairs is dutifully recounted, the private motivations of this hard-drinking, power-loving genius remain, in quintessential 50's style, drowned in nervous laughter. (B&amp;w photos--16 pages--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Von Neumann (1903-1957), the mathematical prodigy who exercised deadly cool logic in developing the Los Alamos atom bomb and in placing Hiroshima on America's list of target cities, was an excessively polite, self-critical, shy genius. Born to a cultured Jewish family in Budapest, this bright light of Weimar Germany and of Depression-era Princeton is usually remembered as a warmonger and a right-wing hawk. But in this affectionate, humanizing biography, former Economist editor Macrae limns a prescient pragmatist who actively fought against fascism and who advocated a policy of nuclear deterrence because he foresaw that Stalin's Soviet Union would rapidly acquire the bomb and develop rocketry. A prime architect of the modern digital computer, von Neumann brought about a revolution in meteorology and left his mark on physics, game theory and economics. Macrae makes these contributions accessible to the lay reader, and also discusses von Neumann's relationships with two long-suffering wives, his political differences with Einstein and the cancer that killed him. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>German Shepherds For Dummies</h2><p>Everybody thinks they know the German Shepherd.

This book focuses on the modeling of the transitions in and out of unemployment, given the stochastic processes that break up jobs and lead to the formation of new jobs, and on the implications of this approach for macroeconomic equilibrium and for the efficiency of the labor market.This approach to labor market equilibrium and unemployment has been successful in explaining the determinants of the "natural" rate of unemployment and new data on job and worker flows, in modeling the labor market in equilibrium business cycle and growth models, and in analyzing welfare policy. The second edition contains two new chapters, one on endogenous job destruction and one on search on the job and job-to-job quitting. The rest of the book has been extensively rewritten and, in several cases, simplified.</p></p><p><p>Christopher A. Pissarides is Professor of Economics at the London School of Economics and a Research Associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research. He received the 2010 Nobel Prize in Economics.</p><p>The unemployment story has many mansions, and this book owns one of them. It analyzes unemployment as a search-and-match-mediated equilibrium of flows through the labor market, set in motion by job destruction and job creation. The new edition adds endogenous job destruction and on-the-job search to the story, and can fairly claim to tell you everything you always wanted to know about search unemployment, but didn't know whom to ask.</p> (Robert M. Solow, Institute Professor of Economics, emeritus, MIT)<br><br><p>Pissarides incorporates imoprtant new developments into equilibrium unemployment theory. A particularly important development is endogenizing job destruction as well as job creation into a unified theoretical framework. This framework, along with new data on job and worker flows, promises to provide a better understanding of unemployment.</p> (Edward C.

The revised model, in dispensing with money and deriving real interest rates from real considerations, reveals itself to be a full subscriber to the natural-rate theory of unemployment.

It also provides an overview of neuroscience for mathematicians who want to learn the basic facts of electrophysiology.<br> <br> <i>Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience</i> presents a systematic study of the relationship of electrophysiology, nonlinear dynamics, and computational properties of neurons. It emphasizes that information processing in the brain depends not only on the electrophysiological properties of neurons but also on their dynamical properties.<br> <br> The book introduces dynamical systems, starting with one- and two-dimensional Hodgkin-Huxley-type models and continuing to a description of bursting systems. Each chapter proceeds from the simple to the complex, and provides sample problems at the end.

In an uncompromising, often irreverent survey of the genre from Edgar Allan Poe to Philip K. Dick to <i>Star Trek,</i> Thomas M. Disch analyzes science fiction's impact on technological innovation, fashion, lifestyle, military strategy, the media, and much more. <br> An illuminating look at the art of science fiction (with a practitioner's insight into craft), as well as a work of pointed literary and cultural criticism, <i>The Dreams Our Stuff Is Made Of</i> reveals how this "pulp genre" has captured the popular imagination while transforming the physical and social world in which we live.</p><p>In <i>The Dreams Our Stuff Is Made Of</i>, Thomas Disch does for science fiction what he did for poetry in <i>The Castle of Indolence</i>. First, he treats it not as a playground for idle dreamers, but as a branch of serious literature with significant cultural impact. Second, he brings the perspective of a seasoned practitioner to bear in separating the wheat from the chaff.<p> For example, if you ever wanted to know why L. Ron Hubbard managed to start a cult but Philip K. Dick didn't, Disch is your man. Beginning with Edgar Allan Poe, Disch elaborates a vision of science fiction as one of the twentieth century's most influential manifestations of America as a culture of liars. Among the frauds are the alien abduction stories of Whitley Strieber, the sadomasochistic dominance fantasies of John Norman, and the co-opting of cyberpunk by postmodern academics and avant-gardists trying to stay hip.</p><p> Disch plays very few favorites, and when ideology gets in the way of good writing, it doesn't matter what side you're on. Subliterary feminist fantasies of matriarchial utopias get slammed just as hard as subliterary conservative militaristic wet dreams. Not even one of sci-fi's most beloved Grand Masters, Robert Heinlein, is unimpeachable; Disch correctly nails Heinlein on his consistent sexism and racism, as well as his gradual descent into solipsism. One of Heinlein's last novels, <i>The Number of the Beast</i>, is described as "the freakout to which [Heinlein]'s entitled as a good American, whose right to lie is protected by the Constitution."</p><p> What <i>does</i> Disch like? For starters: Philip K. Dick, the British New Wave as exemplified by J. G. Ballard and Michael Moorcock, and Joe Haldeman's Hugo- and Nebula-winning <i>The Forever War</i>, described as being "to the Vietnam War what <i>Catch-22</i> was to World War II," and which he believes deserved a Pulitzer as well.</p><p> Disch may confirm your suspicions, or he may raise every last one of your hackles. But one thing this book will definitely not do is bore you.</p><b>Thomas M. Disch</b> is the author of such classic works of science fiction as <i>Camp Concentration, 334, The Brave Little Toaster,</i> and <i>On Wings of Song,</i> all of which are cited in David Pringle's <i>Science Fiction: 100 Best Novels.</i> His criticism has appeared in the country's leading magazines and newspapers. His book <i>The Castle of Indolence</i> was a nominee for the National Book Critic Circle's Award in Criticism.</p><h2>Shakespeare, Race, and Colonialism (Oxford Shakespeare Topics)</h2><p>Did Shakespeare and his contemporaries think at all in terms of &#34;race&#34;? Examining the depiction of cultural, religious, and ethnic difference in Shakespeare&#39;s plays, Ania Loomba considers how seventeenth-century ideas differed from the later ideologies of &#34;race&#34; that emerged during colonialism, as well as from older ideas about barbarism, blackness, and religious difference. Accessible yet nuanced analysis of the plays explores how Shakespeare&#39;s ideas of race were shaped by beliefs about color, religion, nationality, class, money and gender.</p><p>Ania Loomba is a Professor of English, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.<br>"Loomba gives a detailed picture of the concept of race in Shakespeare's day.... Loomba's scholarship is rigorous, carefully grounding interpretation of the plays in the ideologies of Shakespeare's time."--<em>Sixteenth Century Journal</em><p></p><br>"Race and colonialism have certainly become important Shakespearean topics in recent years and one could not hope for a more authoritative and accessible discussion of them than that provided by Ania Loomba.... In sum, this book offers a case study of how to write for a wide readership without betraying the complexity of the subject matter."--<em>Journal of Colonialism and Colonial History</em><p></p><br>"Loomba's compact yet comprehensive <em>Shakespeare, Race, and Colonialism</em> offers a systematic approach to the conjunction of race and Shakespeare.... It covers an impressive range of discursive constructions in the period."--<em>Studies in English Literature 1500-1900</em><p></p><br>"A very interesting treatment about self-definition, difference, and xenophobia."--<em>Biblioth�que d'Humanisme et Renaissance</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Trees, Shrubs, and Vines of the Texas Hill Country: A Field Guide (Louise Lindsey Merrick Natural Environment Series)</h2><p>If you imagine the Texas Hill Country solely as dry limestone slopes of cedar and scrub oak, prepare to have your eyes opened. The Edwards Plateau, upon which the Hill Country sits, is also a land of lush cypress-lined streams, diverse thickets, and shady hardwood bottomlands. Edged by canyonlands and intersected by creeks, these rocky hills support an abundance of trees, shrubs, and vines that provide food and cover for wildlife and create a distinct and durable landscape.<br><br>In this book, Jan Wrede has compiled a field guide to more than 125 species of mostly native, mostly woody plants of the Texas Hill Country. A thoughtful introduction discusses deer, cedar, water, oak wilt, and invasive species timely issues of increasing importance for a growing number of Texas landowners. Plant descriptions contain information about the leaves, flowers, fruit, and bark of each plant and also give insights into the species&#x2019; range and habits. A color photograph accompanies each account.<br><br>Especially useful is a comprehensive plant chart with tips about color, scent, flowering period, height, site preference, and wildlife and livestock utilization.

While news reporting remains the staple of contemporary journalism, increasingly opportunities are opening up for feature writers and even those who aspire to longer forms of journalism and creative non-fiction. Using a step-by-step description of styles and techniques this book will show students how to research, structure and write stories, how to navigate legal and ethical issues, and how to market their work: while learning how to tackle different styles of writing, from profiles, reviews, sports journalism, to issue-based stories, columns, biographies and advertising copy. Along the way they will be introduced to some of Australia&#39;s best-known journalists and writers and the hard lessons they have learned from their experience of writing, helping students forge their path to publishing and a career in feature writing.</p><p><br><strong>Stephen Tanner</strong> is an Associate Professor in the School of Journalism at the University of Wollongong, Sydney.<br><br><strong>Molly Kasinger</strong> is an Assistant Professor in the School of Communication and Media (Journalism), Bond University.<br><br><strong>Nick Richardson</strong> is Group News Editor for News Limited's Leader Community Newspapers in Melbourne.<br></p><h2>From Two Cultures to No Culture: C. P. Snow&#39;s &#39;Two Cultures&#39; Lecture Fifty Years On</h2><p>In 1959 C.P. Snow delivered the annual Rede Lecture in Cambridge under the title of &#39;The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution&#39;. Snow warned of a gap that had opened up between scientists and the &#39;literary intellectuals&#39; that made it almost impossible for the two groups to communicate. Snow complained that literary intellectuals were not only ignorant of science but contemptuous of it, as if scientific knowledge were unnecessary for a good education. Snow believed that improvements in the teaching of science were required in order to address the world&#39;s greatest problems, and that both the USA and the USSR were ahead of Britain in that respect. Snow spoke with the authority of a man with a foot in both camps, as a trained research scientist and a successful novelist, and his lecture provoked worldwide coverage. However, in 1962 it received an extraordinary response from the influential literary critic F.R. Leavis, who delivered an attack on Snow of unprecedented ferocity. The Snow/Leavis controversy has provoked debate ever since between the supporters of both men&#39;s positions as to the real purpose of education. Should science or the humanities be given precedence? Should education aim at the moral formation of the individual or address the world&#39;s practical problems? This volume contains two of the most articulate expositions of each point of view, by Roger Kimball and Raymond Tallis. Frank Furedi considers the implications of Snow&#39;s lecture for the current education debate, while Robert Whelan argues that the choice is no longer between two cultures but between an education system based on academic rigour and no culture at all.</p><p>Frank Furedi is Professor of Sociology at the University of Kent in Canterbury. His research is oriented towards the study of the impact of precautionary culture and risk aversion on Western societies. In his books he has explored controversies and panics over issues such as health, children, food and cultural life. His writings express a concern with the prevailing regime of cultural confusion towards valuing intellectual and artistic pursuits and with the difficulty that society has in providing a challenging education for children and young people. His books include: Politics of Fear: Beyond Left and Right (2005); Where Have All the Intellectuals Gone? Confronting 21st Century Philistinism (2005); Therapeutic Culture: Cultivating Vulnerability in an Anxious Age (2004); Culture of Fear (2002); Paranoid Parenting (2001); and Invitation to Terror (2007).

When he argued the latter based on the New Testament, Abraham Geiger ignited an intense debate that began in nineteenth-century Germany but continues to this day.<br> <br> Geiger, a pioneer of Reform Judaism and a founder of Jewish studies, developed a Jewish version of Christian origins. He contended that Jesus was a member of the Pharisees, a progressive and liberalizing group within first-century Judaism, and that he taught nothing new or original. This argument enraged German Protestant theologians, some of whom produced a tragic counterargument based on racial theory.<br> <br> In this fascinating book, Susannah Heschel traces the genesis of Geiger's argument and examines the reaction to it within Christian theology. She concludes that Geiger initiated an intellectual revolt by the colonized against the colonizer, an attempt not to assimilate into Christianity by adopting Jesus as a Jew, but to overthrow Christian intellectual hegemony by claiming that Christianity&#x2014;and all of Western civilization&#x2014;was the product of Judaism.<br></p></p><p><b>Susannah Heschel</b> is the Eli Black Associate Professor of Jewish Studies in the Department of Religion at Dartmouth College.

In ten interlinked chapters, Michael J. LaRosa and Germ�n R. Mej�a depart from more standard approaches by presenting a history of political, social, and cultural accomplishments within the context of Colombia&#x2019;s specific geographic and economic realities. Their emphasis on cultural development, international relations, and everyday life contrasts sharply with works that focus only on Colombia&#x2019;s violent past or dwell on a Colombian economy deeply dependent on narcotics&#x2014;a tragic nation that barely functions. Instead, the authors emphasize Colombia&#x2019;s remarkable national cohesion and endurance since the early nineteenth-century wars for independence. Including a photo essay, detailed chronology, and resource guide, this concise yet thorough history will be an invaluable resource for all readers seeking a thoughtful, definitive interpretation of Colombia&#x2019;s past and present.</p><p>Michael J. LaRosa is associate professor of history at Rhodes College. Germ�n R. Mej�a is professor of history at Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogot�.Without engaging in whitewashing or leaving behind academic rigor and meticulous historical detail, the authors . . . have maintained an engaging balance between the more tragic aspects of Colombian history and its successes. . . . Their narrative is present-focused and organized thematically, rather than following a standard chronology. It explores in small, easily digestible sections subjects like demography, political culture, infrastructure development and, of course, conflict. . . . The book, written in English as a collaboration between two historians from the United States and Colombia, is intended for a foreign audience of non-experts. However, it manages to engage, and even surprise, readers that might be more familiar with Colombia. Those that have spent significant time in the country will recognize in the book&#x2019;s pages the quirky details of Colombian life that tell as much about the country as the goriest details of its civil war. . . . I applaud Mej�a and LaRosa for abandoning the seductive lure of gore in Colombian history and making an honest and serious effort to tell a more complete and complex story. (<i>ReVista: Harvard Review of Latin America</i>)<br><br>LaRosa and Mej�a iconoclastically focus on the factors that produced cohesion in Colombia between 1800 and 2011, rather than on the violence that has torn the country apart. Their topical chapters highlight the existence of long-lasting constitutions, two national political parties, a diverse but predominantly mestizo and urban population, recent improvements in transportation, a common language and religion, a healthy economy, and an appreciation for culture that has produced internationally prominent artists. They correctly note that Colombia was not uniquely violent in 19th-century Latin America. . . . Although keeping the focus on the resiliency of the people who have suffered through decades of tragedy, the authors do discuss enduring social problems like the highly unequal distribution of income. Their approach provides a good corrective to much current scholarship on Colombia. . . . Recommended. (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>Perhaps due to the cooperation of its government with the U.S.&#x2019; war on drugs, Colombia is probably America&#x2019;s closest ally in South America. This concise and easily digestible survey is a useful and timely introduction to a country little understood by most people north of the Rio Grande. LaRosa is professor of history at Rhodes College, and Mej�a is professor of history at Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogot�. They combine thematic and chronological approaches to offer a broad-based portrait of Colombia in an admirable effort to counteract many of the oversimplified impressions outsiders may have concerning the country. They don&#x2019;t avoid the seamier aspects of historical and contemporary Colombia, including political violence and the curse of the traffic in narcotics. But they also note the nation&#x2019;s considerable cultural achievements and its laudable efforts to build a stable democracy and play a positive role in hemispheric relations. (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>The book by Michael J. LaRosa and Germ�n R. Mej�a is well written and covers effectively most of the important events of 'modern' Colombian history, defined by the authors as the years since 1800. . . . The authors aimed to have a new work of history that would be bold, energetic, and innovative, not focusing on the catastrophic vision of the country or theoretical constructs from the developed world. Rather, despite all the mayhem the country has experienced, they wanted to explore a central question: 'How is it that the nation stays together?' (<i>The Americas: A Quarterly Review of Latin American History</i>)<br><br>This book succeeds in offering a distinct interpretation of Colombian history, one which conveys the complexities of a nation that falls outside so many Latin American 'norms'. It is written with care, insight and deep affection. For readers unfamiliar with the country, it offers accessible and engaging insights. For others, it is a worthy companion to Bushnell, Palacios, Safford and other authors. (<i>Journal of Latin American Studies</i>)<br><br>This sensitive and engagingly written historical introduction to Colombia moves beyond the nation&#x2019;s conflicts and failures to uncover what also holds its people together. Readers will be especially drawn to the rich portrayal of Colombia&#x2019;s deep cultural traditions, expressed in art and literature and in people&#x2019;s daily lives. (Herbert Tico Braun, University of Virginia)<br><br>This imaginative, go-to analysis makes the intriguing and multi-faceted world of Colombia accessible to all readers. LaRosa and Mej�a artfully break away from the classic approach to the writing of Colombian history and provide an insightful window into the country&#x2019;s political, social, and cultural past. Their thematic approach enhances a story born of a common love for sport and the arts, for drama and for political ideals. LaRosa and Mej�a make ever present the rich heritage of this country and of a people who have fought passionately for liberty over the past two centuries. (Douglass Sullivan-Gonz�lez, dean of the Sally McDonnell Barksdale Honors College, University of Mississippi)<br><br>A unique and refreshing assessment of the contemporary history of Colombia. Highlighting the lesser-known aspects of Colombia&#x2019;s history, LaRosa and Mej�a have succeeded in producing a well-balanced narrative. Unlike most treatments of modern Colombia, which linger on its tragedies and failures, the authors focus on the creativity, resourcefulness, and resilience of its people and the myriad ways in which they have contributed to building their country. LaRosa and Mej�a&#x2019;s reinterpretation of the contemporary history of Colombia is an important contribution to our understanding of a little-known and understood country.

The simple field marks are often poorly lit, hard to spot, or simply not shown by any particular individual under observation. But accurate identification of these popular and beautiful birds brings both real satisfaction and a welcome challenge to most birders.</p><br><p> Steve Howell, a well-known and respected bird tour leader and author, has made a particular study of the finer points of hummingbird recognition and has specially chosen over 200 stunning photographs to complement the information given in his text. Some species feature as many as 14 photographs each. A detailed introduction covers the basics of hummingbird anatomy and plumage variation, allowing the observer to effectively focus on points that are of value in the field.

With thoroughly detailed text and large, beautiful photos, <i>Hummingbirds of North America: The Photographic Guide</i> lives up to its reputation as a rich visual guide to some of the most beautiful birds in North America.

Once introduced to these principles, he became an instant convert. After several years of in -depth work, Traub developed the NAIC&#39;s official software, The Investor&#39;s Toolkit, now used by more than 40,000 investors. He teaches the NAIC investing method to standing-room-only audiences around the country and is a regular speaker at NAIC conferences. Take Stock is as important for what it says you don&#39;t have to know as for teaching you what you should. Building on the simple concepts taught by NAIC, Mr. Traub strips away the intimidating jargon the pros use to make themselves seem more knowledgeable. Cutting the required financial vocabulary to only ten simple terms, Traub shows you, in a breezy and good-natured style, how to apply those terms to learn the only two things you need to know about investment: if the company is good enough to buy, and, if so, the right price to pay for its stock. &#34;Few people have done as much to help empower individuals to become successful investors as Ellis Traub. His book leaves the chaos and confusion of the investing world behind and puts readers on a simple brick road through Wall Street. His message: Yes, you can. Here&#39;s how!&#34; -Donald E. Danko, CFA, Editor, Better Investing</p><p>I lost nearly everything I had in the stock market years ago---and was scared out of investing for many years. So I wrote this book to share with others the simple truths that could have made a huge difference for me had I known them then---things that work for me now. <p>Successful investing is not "rocket science." And the NAIC (National Association of Investors Corporation), a 50-year old, non-profit organization proved to me that anyone can do it---even people who knew as little as I did. I've simply tried to pass on what I've learned in as easy-to-understand a way as I could. My hope is that each book that gets into someone's hands represents one more person that will avoid my unhappy experience and enjoy success earlier in life than I did.</p>Ellis Traub is a self taught 'number cruncher'. His credentials stem from sheer determination to overcome the bad professional advice that lost him his son's college savings. In an attempt to recover his losses, he learned the NAIC investing principles and was soon teaching and speaking to standing room only audiences. To further popularize the highly successful methods embraced by the more than 750,000 members of NAIC, Traub developed an interactive CD-ROM, <i>The Investors Toolkit</i>.

Democrats and Republicans have fiercely contested issues such as prescription drug coverage and how to finance Medicare to absorb the baby boomers. As Jonathan Oberlander demonstrates in <i>The Political Life of Medicare</i>, these developments herald the reopening of a historic debate over Medicare's fundamental purpose and structure. Revealing how Medicare politics and policies have developed since Medicare's enactment in 1965 and what the program's future holds, Oberlander's timely and accessible analysis will interest anyone concerned with American politics and public policy, health care politics, aging, and the welfare state.</p><p>Jonathan Oberlander is an assistant professor of social medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he teaches health policy in the School of Medicine and the Department of Political Science.&#x201c;This book combines in-depth personal interviews, historical data, and legislative records in an insightful case study of Medicare.&nbsp; The 50-year history of this program is enlivened by a search for patterns based on theories from political science. . . . The book also explores new theories of path dependence and the roles of ideas in public policy in the US.&#x201d; (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br><p>"A&nbsp;brilliant little book, combining a grasp of programmatic and political detail sure to appeal to scholars of health policy with crisp prose and careful argument accessible to policymakers and most of Medicare&#x2019;s beneficiaries. . . . Oberlander&#x2019;s analysis is organized around three persistent tensions in Medicare politics: the gap between the program&#x2019;s promise and its performance; the fiscal and administrative tug-of-war between private provision and public payment; and the political and actuarial dilemma of delivering &#x2018;service&#x2019; benefits on a foundation of social insurance financing.&nbsp; . . . The meat of the book tackles the post-1965 history of Medicare&#x2019;s fragile consensus regarding program benefits, financing, and administration.&#x201d;</p> (Colin Gordon <i>Health Affairs</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;This is a very good (and very well written) book for anyone interested in US health politics." (Robin Gauld <i>Political Studies Review</i>)<br><br><p>&#x201c;Clearly, no one can claim to understand contemporary American politics and policymaking without understanding the Medicare program. Few scholars are more knowledgeable about Medicare politics than health policy expert Jonathan Oberlander. Combining rich, detailed narrative with acute political analysis, Oberlander offers an illuminating guide to Medicare&#x2019;s evolution since the program&#x2019;s creation in 1965. The book immediately takes its place as the best short monograph on Medicare&#x2019;s political development, current status, and future prospects. . . . Well-organized, elegantly written, and jam-packed with sophisticated insights about the substance and process of U.S, policymaking, the book deserves to be read by anyone concerned with American national government, health-care politics, and the welfare state.&#x201d;</p> (Eric M.

Poetical Works: Part 1. Poems (Reading Text). (Collected Works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, 17)</h2><p><p>Poetry in its many guises is at the center of Coleridge's multifarious interests, and this long-awaited new edition of his complete poetical works marks the pinnacle of the Bollingen Collected Coleridge. The three parts of Volume 16 confirm and expand the sense of the Coleridge who has emerged over the past half-century, with implications for English Romantic writing as a whole. Setting new standards of comprehensiveness in the presentation of Romantic texts, they will interest historians and editorial theorists, as well as readers and students of poetry. They represent a work of truly monumental importance.</p><br><p> The first part presents the reading texts of 706 poems in chronological sequence. Its blend of newly discovered and newly collected poems, presented in light of all known evidence and where practicable in unrevised forms, offers a fresh and original Coleridge: less inhibited by Victorian ideas about what poetry should be, moving easily and productively between genres and levels of seriousness. In texts that remained fluid and exploratory to the end, Coleridge alternates between lyric and satire, prophecy and conversation, symbol and allegory.</p><br><p> Each poem is accompanied by a headnote and commentary that together provide its historical-biographical context and offer key textual variants. The book opens with an introduction and chronological tables. The three appendixes position individual poems in the contexts in which they appeared during Coleridge's lifetime. Illustrations such as contemporary scenes and portraits bring this rich collection, like the companion volumes, all the more to life.</p></p><p><b>J.C.C.

These patients are pervasive in psychotherapeutic practice, but are often misdiagnosed as neurotic, borderline, or narcissistic. Far more attention is devoted in the literature to the narcissistic and borderline conditions than to this most common of the personality disorders.<br>Schizoid patients go through the motions of daily living, but superficially, like robots, without any zest or enthusiasm. They may be involved in ongoing relationships and social situations, but they do not experience the joy or pain of living because a crucial part of their feelings has been radically repressed and isolated from their central personality. They have split off the emotional hunger for love, care, and contact, and at the heart of the personality there is a core of emptiness. The hunger for love, first felt as a vital, fleeting need, becomes a constant state of mind as it remains unmet. This state of mind is split off from the remaining personality, and gradually its needs are extinguished. The active emptiness of hunger becomes a frozen, static, lifeless emptiness. Thus, schizoid patients experience a death-in-life and a pervasive, compulsive conflictual hunger for things: food, drugs, sex, money, admiration, or tyranny over others to fill the empty core. They go through life as the living dead, hungering for things, as the vampire thirsts for blood to keep itself going.<br>In treatment, these patients go through the motions of therapy without genuine involvement. Initially, therapists often mistake them for easy patients because they do not make inordinate demands. The therapist may forget to discuss the patient in supervision or never think of him between sessions. Dr. Seinfeld poignantly describes the apathy that gradually pervades the therapeutic relationship. A profound fear of rejection and merger underlies the patient's seeming indifference to the therapist, and the patient may drop out after a small mistake or a therapeutic lapse in empathy.<br>Dr. Seinfeld shows how the therapist can engage these patients while avoiding the common therapeutic pitfalls. The book delineates the phases of the treatment process and presents clear guidelines for intervention, which requires exquisite timing and precision. With extensive clinical vignettes, Dr. Seinfeld guides the reader in reaching the lost, empty heart of the schizoid personality.</p><p></p><h2>Indonesia: Peoples and Histories</h2><p>Indonesia is the fourth largest country in the world.

When goals are not used to prioritize efforts and resources, which in turn focuses behavior, people naturally return to the daily list of urgent problems, issues, crises, and new initiatives, ending each day feeling overwhelmed by the sheer volume of activities. Furthermore, goal setting is rarely used at the classroom level to improve rates of learning, even though they are powerful in improving achievement. This book s premise is that by implementing SMART (Strategic and Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Results-based and Time-bound) goals, educators have the ability to transform their schools and classrooms into places where each and every student meets and exceeds standards. Before educators can embrace SMART goals, however, they must first focus their thinking on results. The authors present several frameworks for adult and student goal-setting and then discuss: the barriers to goal-setting and monitoring; how to keep goals alive through supportive systems, policies, structures, and skill-building; the role of assessment in goal-setting; the power of goals to improve curriculum, instruction, and assessment; the role of professional development practices in goal-setting and improvement; how to build capacity for goal-oriented thinking; and case studies from real schools that are turning challenges into opportunities for learning and improvement.</p><p><p><b>Anne E.

This interpretation is the basis for the claim that no paradigm shift, ideology critique, or new way of thinking can dispense with or overcome such modernist aspirations. In fact, the author argues, one can still detect the persistence of such aspirations and commitments in some of the harshest modernity critics, in Nietzsche and in Heidegger especially.</p> <p>This unique and engaging view of modernity is an essential read for students, academics, and researchers studying Modernism, 20th Century Philosophy, Social Theory, and Hegel and German Idealism.</p><b>Robert B.

His parents had emigrated from the USA to begin sheep farming, and the young William grew up herding stock with local 'gauchos', the freedom-loving cowboys of the pampas, and studying the wildlife of the area. He also began writing, both for scientific journals, and increasingly, books containing his own thoughts and ideas on a wide variety of subjects. 'The Purple Land' is William Hudson's exuberant first novel. Set in the turbulent political times of Uruguay's birth, it tells the tale of European adventurer Richard Lamb, who elopes with the lovely Paquita, thereby earning the undying enmity of her powerful father. Desperate to support his wife, he sets off on a series of increasingly wild adventures that includes horse-stealing, a fight to the death, imprisonment and escape - and culminates in a pitched battle between the two main political parties, 'Whites' and 'Reds', with our hero unfortunately picking the losing side. In between, Richard manages to win the hearts of at least three Latin beauties, all of whom further complicate his already convoluted existence. But 'The Purple Land' is far more than a simple adventure story. Constructed as an early form of 'road novel', Hudson fills its pages with intimate sketches of the people and the customs of mid-nineteenth century pampas life, colourful vignettes set among his masterful depiction of the region's wildlife and its matchless natural beauty.</p></p><p>William Henry Hudson was born in Argentina, the son of American settlers from New England. He spent his youth studying the local flora and fauna, and, as a young man, traveled widely on horseback, visiting Brazil, Uruguay, and Patagonia.In 1869, at the age of 28, he settled in England, and began a new life as a wanderer and field naturalist.</p><h2>Chaos in Dynamical Systems</h2><p>In the new edition of this classic textbook Ed Ott has added much new material and has significantly increased the number of homework problems. The most important change is the addition of a completely new chapter on control and synchronization of chaos. Other changes include new material on riddled basins of attraction, phase locking of globally coupled oscillators, fractal aspects of fluid advection by Lagrangian chaotic flows, magnetic dynamos, and strange nonchaotic attractors.</p><p>Edward Ott is currently on the faculty of the University of Maryland where he holds the title of Distinguished University Professor of Physics and of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Before coming to Maryland in 1979, he was a Professor of Electrical Engineering at Cornell University (1968-1979). Prof. Ott&#39;s early research was on plasma physics and charged particle beams, including research on space plasmas, fusion plasmas, intense ion beams, and electromagnetic wave generation by electron beams. Since the early 1980s, Prof. Ott&#39;s main research interests have been in nonlinear dynamics and its applications to problems in science and engineering. Some of this work includes contributions in the areas of bifurcations of chaotic sets, the fractal dimension of strange attractors, the structure of basin boundaries, applications of chaotic dynamics to problems in fluids and plasmas, and the control and synchronization of chaos. Prof. Ott has also been active in the education of students in nonlinear dynamics. He is an author of over 300 research articles in scientific journals."...a stimulating selection of topics that could be taught a la carte in postgraduate courses. The book is given unity by a preoccupation with scaling arguments, but covers almost all aspects of the subject (dimensions of strange attractors, transitions to chaos, thermodynamic formalism, scattering quantum chaos and so on...Ott has managed to capture the beauty of this subject in a way that should motivate and inform the next generation of students in applied dynamical systems." Nature<br><br>"...a book that will be of most interest to physicists and engineers...The book is well written, and does contain material that is hard to find elsewhere. In particular, the discussion of fractal basin boundaries is lucidly written, and this is an important topic."

Why? Because Jonah was the boy she knew only through texts and emails but understood to his very core. Jonah was the only boy she&#x2019;d told she loved and the only boy to say it back. And Jonah was the boy whose suicide she never saw coming.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jonah&#x2019;s death has sent Tess pinwheeling into grief and confusion. But even though he&#x2019;s gone, Tess still writes to him. She wants answers to the yawning chasm of questions that&#x2019;s become her life. At the same time, she&#x2019;s trying to find solace in her father&#x2019;s alternative funeral business. Who knew that arranging last rites for prized pets could be so life-affirming? But love, loss, and life are so much more complicated than Tess ever thought . . . especially after she receives a message that turns her already inside-out world totally upside down.<br> &nbsp;<br> As funny as it is heartbreaking and completely unputdownable, <i>Things I&#x2019;m Seeing Without You</i> shows us what it means to love someone, to lose someone, to wade through the beautiful/strange agony of the aftermath, and somehow love again.<br><br><b>"Sometimes hilarious, always affecting."</b> --<i>VOYA</i><br><b>"Nails the messiness of grief."</b> --<i>SLJ</i><br><b>"Compelling . . . a draw for fans of Nicola Yoon."</b> --<i>BCCB</i></p><p>Peter Bognanni is a graduate of the Iowa Writers&#x2019; Workshop.

It smelled like Old Spice and middle-aged sadness in the guest room, and this was probably at least part of the reason for my thoughts of total cosmic annihilation. The other part I blame on physics. The class I mean. Not the branch of science. It was one of the last subjects I tried to study before I made the decision to liberate myself from Quaker school, driving five hours through Iowa farm country to make my daring escape.</p><p>I did the drive without stopping, listening to religious radio fade in and out of classic rock, which sounded something like this: &#x201c;<i>Our </i>God is an awesome Godddddd and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ooooh that smell. Can&#x2019;t you smell that smell? The smell of death surrounds you!&#x201d; All I could smell was fertilizer. And as the empty fields and pinwheeling wind turbines passed by my window, I tried not to think too hard about how I had let things get to this point. And I tried even harder not to think of the improbable person I had come to love, who would no longer be in my life.</p><p>But back to the universe for a moment.</p><p>There seems to be no real consensus about how it&#x2019;s all going to end, and that&#x2019;s what had me worried in the predawn hours. If the worst is going to happen, as it always does, I&#x2019;d at least like to know some details. But current theories are too varied to be of any real help.</p><p>Some people think the Big Bang is just going to happen in reverse. Like: <i>BANG!</i> Everything to nothing! Deal with it fools! Other people think that outer space is just going to go dark and cold, stars blinking out like candles on an interstellar birthday cake. And still others think that time itself will come to an end like an old man&#x2019;s watch that someone forgot to wind.</p><p>If forced to choose, I&#x2019;d probably go with the last option. Not because it sounds like a barrel of laughs. But if it&#x2019;s all going to freeze like the last frame of an eighties movie, I think I could deal with it as long as I get to pick the right moment.</p><p>For example, I could be jumping off a cliff, locked in flight like a majestic Pegasus. Or I could be mid-hiccup, frozen in a deranged bodily spasm for all of time. Or maybe I could just round up all the people I&#x2019;ve disappointed in the last few months and issue one giant apology before it all goes still. I could shout it through a megaphone. I AM TESS FOWLER AND I HAVE MADE TERRIBLE MISTAKES! MY BAD! PLEASE ENJOY THE VOID!</p><p>And I guess if someone twisted my arm I might also opt for an eternal orgasm.</p><p>The Long Bang, if you will.</p><p>But the key here is that I want the power. I want to know when it&#x2019;s going to happen, and I want the ability to choose my last act when the time comes. Because, lately, I&#x2019;ve been feeling like I don&#x2019;t have much control at all.</p><p>Dropping out of high school, as it turns out, is only mildly empowering. It <i>is</i> remarkably easy, though. All you have to do is wake up one morning and realize that you are failing the shit out of all of your classes, you have alienated most of the people who were once your friends, and you haven&#x2019;t really felt like a functioning human being for well over a month.</p><p>At which point, I recommend stealing the last emergency joint from your roommate&#x2019;s Mickey Mouse Band-Aid tin, walking to the two-lane highway that frames the entrance to Forever Friends Quaker Academy, and puffing away while saying good-bye to a place that almost felt like home for a while. Then I suggest you get in your Ford Festiva and blow town like a fugitive.</p><p>I neglected to wake my roommate, Emma, before I took off. She had snuck her boyfriend in again, and they were locked in a pornographic pretzel hold that defied the imagination. Seriously, they were like conjoined staircases in an Escher drawing, only naked and with more body hair.</p><p>So, instead of saying good-bye, I left her the twenty-five bucks I owed her, along with the rest of my orange ginger body mist, which she was always stealing anyway. Then I walked out and closed that door forever.</p><p>It sounds harsh but we never really had an honest conversation in our seven months together. Or even a fight. True, I was with her that time she didn&#x2019;t get her period and we watched clips of Teen Mom on YouTube and cried. But we weren&#x2019;t best friends. I&#x2019;ll never be her maid of honor, giving a tearful speech at her destination wedding. And I probably won&#x2019;t be giving her a kidney. At least not my favorite one.</p><p>But, for the last few months we slept two feet apart in a room the size of a prison cell. We shared a shower caddy. We held each other&#x2019;s hair when we got too drunk on Malibu and our barf smelled like suntan lotion. There&#x2019;s an intimacy in that.</p><p>I also declined to notify Elaine at Health Services, which I imagine will come to bite me squarely on the ass sooner or later. Elaine is the woman who has been talking to me about my &#x201c;grieving process&#x201d; for the last month or so. She is nice enough, I suppose, and she gives warm hugs. But when I see the pictures of her dog dressed in Halloween costumes, I am sad for her. It&#x2019;s like all the problems of girls like me have zapped her ability to have a real life. Now all she can do is worry and walk her spaniel.</p><p>Ultimately, though, I just couldn&#x2019;t deal with another one of her phone calls, where she asks such painfully earnest questions while not-so-secretly trying to ascertain whether or not I am going to off myself at her school. Well, I&#x2019;m gone now, Elaine, so you don&#x2019;t need to worry about that anymore. I give you permission to be relieved. Have an extra drink at the staff happy hour this week. You deserve it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I suppose it&#x2019;s worth mentioning here that I am squatting in my father&#x2019;s home at present, with no immediate plans to leave it. The house is a sagging two-bedroom in Minneapolis where he&#x2019;s lived since his marriage to my mother unraveled like a bad sweater. And I am back living in it for two reasons that I can discern.</p><p>The first is that it is only a morning&#x2019;s drive away from my hippie school in Iowa, and that seemed like a good amount of time to be in a car with myself. The second is that my mother is currently on an extended retreat in India with her new boyfriend, Lars, practicing something called Ashtanga Yoga, which I take great delight in not picturing. So, I journeyed to Dad&#x2019;s bachelor rental, where he runs a funeral-planning business out of my former bedroom.</p><p>Yes, you read that correctly.</p><p>For the last few years, my father has been trying to find exciting new angles in the Death business. He has been doing this despite any real training and a steady lack of encouragement from nearly everyone he knows.</p><p>There are still piles of unfinished coffins in the garage from his first attempt at &#x201c;artisanal caskets.&#x201d; And now that he&#x2019;s trying to work as a funeral planner, there are pamphlets all over my old bedroom that say &#x201c;Plan for the Party of Your Life!&#x201d; (Which really means your DEATH. Surprise!)</p><p>This is not new behavior from him, unfortunately, and it&#x2019;s very much part of the reason we don&#x2019;t talk too often anymore. If I had to be more specific, I would say that most of the reason we don&#x2019;t talk is the fact that he drained a college fund in my name to cover costs for another of his &#x201c;ventures.&#x201d; That one was a mobile spa unit he could drive to the homes of the elderly to perform hot stone massages on their seminude bodies in their driveways. Sweet idea, Dad. How did that fail to take off?</p><p>He was, of course, going to pay the money &#x201c;right back!&#x201d; But somehow he just ended up borrowing more from my mom&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. without asking her. Yet, despite all this, I called him last night in a moment of weakness. Or desperation. Or maybe just to give him fair warning about my ruined life.</p><p>Anyway, when I got through, I caught him on a beach in Nantucket, where I immediately heard what sounded like fireworks launching into the night sky.</p><p>&#x201c;Duncan Fowler!&#x201d; he shouted over a prolonged screech.</p><p>&#x201c;Dad?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hello? This is DUNCAN!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;DAD. THIS IS TESS!&#x201d;</p><p>The screech came to an end.</p><p>&#x201c;Tess,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t blame him for asking. The only time he ever got a call from me was when something was going horribly.</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; I lied. &#x201c;Nothing is going horribly.&#x201d;</p><p>A deafening explosion stepped on my line.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;NOTHING IS WRONG!&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;EVERYTHING IS PERFECT!&#x201d;</p><p>Silence.</p><p>&#x201c;Dad,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;What the hell is going on? It sounds like an air raid over there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be honest.&#x201d; He sighed. &#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t caught me at the best time, kid.&#x201d;</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t remember a time when I had.</p><p>&#x201c;I just have to tell you one thing,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be quick.&#x201d;</p><p>I took a breath and made sure another boom wasn&#x2019;t coming.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m quitting,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t wait for him to respond.</p><p>&#x201c;I gave up. On school. I&#x2019;m quitting and coming home, probably forever. I hope that&#x2019;s cool with you.&#x201d;</p><p>I expected a gasp. Or at very least a sigh. All I got was another crackle in the air.</p><p>&#x201c;Dad?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I lost you for a minute. Did you say something?&#x201d;</p><p>I closed my eyes and mouthed a few f-bombs.</p><p>&#x201c;Forgive me, Tess,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The ceremony isn&#x2019;t going so great here. The rockets just went off ahead of schedule and people are kind of freaking.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wait a minute. Rockets? What are you talking about?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They were supposed to go off at twelve, but it&#x2019;s only eleven thirty. I&#x2019;m not sure why that&#x2019;s such a big deal, but apparently Zebulon was born just after midnight.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who is <i>Zebulon</i>?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>I both did and did not want to know.</p><p>&#x201c;A Borzoi!&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Beautiful dog. At least, he was. He&#x2019;s been through a cremulator now, poor guy. He belonged to a famous science fiction writer. Thus, the rockets. And the name Zebulon, I guess. He&#x2019;s being launched as we speak. It&#x2019;s really quite&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Another staccato of bursts.</p><p>&#x201c;Hold on. You&#x2019;re doing dog funerals now?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;this is technically a <i>life celebration</i>, but yeah. It&#x2019;s sort of an untapped market. Anyway, I&#x2019;m kind of busy. And it&#x2019;s almost exam time for you, right? What do they have you doing at that school, birthing a calf?&#x201d;</p><p>For a moment, I considered telling him the truth. I considered telling him that I was no longer learning things at the expensive private high school where my mom had sent me to &#x201c;self-actualize,&#x201d; and &#x201c;build community.&#x201d; I considered telling him I was, instead, at his house in Minneapolis, eating out of his sad bachelor fridge and getting ready to sleep in my old room&#x2014;which now looked like a cross between a home accountant&#x2019;s office and a prostitute&#x2019;s garret&#x2014;but then I heard some shouts from a faraway crowd.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh crap,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Not good. The smoke is blowing back toward the beach. I need to move the old people. We&#x2019;ll talk about this later, okay, Tessie?&#x201d;</p><p>And then, just like that, he was gone.</p><p>So, I closed my eyes and lay back on the bed.</p><p>It was and still is a single mattress bought for a smaller me. A smaller me who peed the bed well into her sixth year and was afraid of the dark until fifteen when she discovered Xanax and droning guitars. I hadn&#x2019;t slept on it in almost a year until last night. Now the springs are shot and the mattress dips in the middle like a hammock. But, still, I tried to find sleep in the office of death.</p><p>It was too quiet, though. I had been conditioned by Quaker school, and now I needed the sound of shouts echoing down the residence hall, and the rustles and shuffles of Emma and her boyfriend trying to have considerate sex across the room when they thought I was sleeping. I needed the sounds of other people, whatever those might be. Reminders that I wasn&#x2019;t completely alone.</p><p>So my attempt at shut-eye didn&#x2019;t last too long. And instead of making some tea, or meditating, I got up and I sent a long message to the Facebook account of a person who no longer exists.</p><p>The vacant person&#x2019;s name is Jonah.</p><p>His account is vacant because he&#x2019;s not alive anymore.</p><p>Still, despite his un-aliveness, I sent my message to him. I told him about trying to go to bed in a room full of eerily upbeat death brochures. I told him about a new iPhone app that identified constellations when you point it at the night sky. I told him I missed his late night texts, his rambling e-mails, and the sound of his laughter on my voice mail. And I told him that I was home, but it didn&#x2019;t feel like home anymore.</p><p>I also told him that everything happening to me was entirely his fault.</p><p>That if I hadn&#x2019;t known him, hadn&#x2019;t fallen for him against my better judgment, none of this would be occurring. I wouldn&#x2019;t be wearing the same clothes I wore yesterday. I wouldn&#x2019;t be lying on my sagging mattress from sixth grade, unable to move. I wouldn&#x2019;t be a high school dropout. And I wouldn&#x2019;t be barely holding in the full-body heartache that threatened to swallow me whole whenever I looked at his profile picture.</p><p>Then I waited two hours for a response that I knew would never come.</p><p>Which finally leads me to everything that happened this morning, and the story I intended to tell in the first place before I began talking about other doomed things like the universe and Zebulon the rocket dog.</p><p>So, I&#x2019;d like to give this another try, if you don&#x2019;t mind. My English teacher, Mr. Barthold, once told me that I need to &#x201c;trust the process,&#x201d; when crafting a piece of writing, and that &#x201c;the essential truth is a slippery thing.&#x201d;</p><p>Duly noted, Mr. B. Even though you are an embittered man clinging to a single published novel like a participation trophy, you sounded genuine when you said this. So I shall heed your advice and trust the process. Okay?</p><p>Fantastic.</p><p>Here goes.</p></p><h2>New Media in Late 20th-Century Art (World of Art)</h2><p>Twentieth-century art has often been characterized as a sweeping break from the tradition of painting. All the major art movements, from Cubism and Dada to Performance and Installation, were initiated as reactions to the centuries-old tradition of representing the world visually in recognizable ways. New definitions of art and the countless ways in which art can be made and experienced now place the artist firmly at the center of the artistic enterprise. This intelligent survey traces the history of new media in art and includes discussions of video art, digital art, and media and performance by artists such as Nam June Paik, Vito Acconci, Marina Abramowic, Pipilotti Rist, and Bill Viola. Initiated by advances and inventions outside the world of art, technology-based art (which encompasses a wide range of practices from photography to film to video to virtual reality) has directed artists into areas once dominated by engineers and technicians.</p><p>Michael Rush, a filmmaker and theater artist, writes for Art New England, Performing Arts Journal, and other publications.YA-Three excellent series titles. Contemporary African Art emphasizes the changes in the art of this continent in the last half of the 20th century. Maya Art examines the reasons behind the artwork and ways the buildings were constructed, incorporating new archaeological findings. They include recent deciphers of Mayan writing that provide understanding to the ceramics, sculpture, architecture, murals, and books. Amazingly, op art and pop art have become almost traditional. With chapters on performance art (Rauschenberg), video, digital, and virtual reality, New Media truly introduces the new wave. The paper in these compact books is of high quality, resulting in outstanding, almost platelike reproduction of the numerous color and black-and-white photos. The illustrations are fully captioned and they alone could justify purchase of these titles.<br><i>Claudia Moore, W. T. Woodson High School, Fairfax, VA </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Gods of the Morning</h2><p><p><strong>A celebration of birds that reflects a year in the wild, revealing how these amazing creatures embody our changing world, by one of Britain's foremost naturalists.</strong></p><em>Gods of the Morning</em> follows the year through the turning of the seasons at Aigas, the Highlands estate John Lister-Kaye has transformed into a world-renowned wildlife center. John's affection, wisdom and lyricism sings off every page, bringing the natural world around him to life: from the rookery filled with twenty-nine nests and distinct bird calls to descriptions of the winter morning light, from the wood mice and the squirrels preparing for winter to tracking a fox's path through the snow. In particular it brings John's lifelong love of birds&#x2015;his gods of the morning&#x2015;to the fore.<br><br> In the Highland glens, bird numbers plummet as their food supplies&#x2015;natural fruits and every kind of creeping, crawling, slithering or flying bug&#x2015;begin to disappear. Not just the swallows and house martins have vanished from round the houses. Gone are the insect snatching wheatears, whinchats and stonechats from the hills, and redstarts and flycatchers have fled the woods. Pied wagtails no longer flicker across the lawns and sandpipers and grey wagtails have deserted the river banks. Farmland and hedgerow species have vanished in the night: the linnets, yellowhammers, and all the warblers have decamped from the thickets.<br><br> By the first frosts the hills will have emptied down to a few hardy stalwarts such as the golden eagles, the raven and the irrepressible hooded crows. Silence settles across the land. The few species that are left frequent a changed world. Soon only the buzzards and wood pigeons will hang on in the woods and the coniferous forests will be host to flocks of chaffinches, tits, siskins, and crossbills passing through.</p><p>John Lister-Kaye is one of Britain&#39;s foremost naturalists and conservationists. He is the author of eight books on wildlife and the environment, including At the Water&#39;s Edge, and has lectured on three continents. He has served prominently in the RSPB, the Nature Conservancy Council, Scottish Natural Heritage and the Scottish Wildlife Trust. In 2003 he was awarded an OBE for services to nature conservation. He lives with his wife and family among the mountains of the Scottish Highlands, where he runs the world-famous Aigas Field Centre.&#x201c;An earnest and impassioned meditation on the natural environment. Insightful. Whether dealing with small birds or larger animals, Lister-Kaye reminds readers of the connections humans forge every day with other creatures&#x2015;and the emotions that result are unquestionably real and significant.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Though Lister-Kaye warns of the damage caused by humankind, and sometimes strikes an elegiac note, he sings full-throatedly in praise of the persistence of nature.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Times (London)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Lister-Kaye is a gifted writer, braiding memories of childhood and wide-ranging journeys as a naturalist with the rhythms of life at Aigas, a lace he knows intimately. Aigas, however, is becoming less familiar...he knows too much to settle for simple answers. <em>Gods of the Morning</em>&nbsp;perfectly encapsulates the paradoxical relations human beings have to the natural world. The sense of personal stewardship and individual responsibility that Lister-Kaye embodies is a vital element of conservation, as important as the understanding that wildlife belongs to nobody, and to everybody. We are all lords of the manor; the only question is how well we will do our jobs.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;I love this book. No one writes more movingly, or with such transporting poetic skill, about encounters with wild creatures.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Helen Macdonald, New York Times bestselling author of 'H is for Hawk'</strong><br><br>&#x201c;With an untameable enthusiasm and generosity of spirit, Lister-Kaye translates those languages into a kind of inter-species friendship.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jay Griffiths, author of 'Wild: An Elemental Journey'</strong><br><br>&#x201c;To read <em>Gods of the Morning</em> is to sink back into the grass, slip away from rush-hour traffic and conference calls, and notice once again the bugs circling in the dirt and that first hint of fall in the air. Lister-Kaye, who time and again homes in on familiar subjects, stripping away pretensions and introducing the vigor and realism that&#x2019;s often missing from nature writing. After all, what is nature writing if not a tacit endorsement for bucking the trail? <em>Gods of the Morning</em> is a book you&#x2019;ll want to put down, not because you&#x2019;ve lost your interest, but precisely because you&#x2019;ve found it&#x2015;in the birds outside your window, in the grass beneath your feet, in the moonlight between the trees.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Audobon</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A distinguished British naturalist reflects on his encounters with the birds of the Scottish Highlands and how global warming has impacted these populations. An evocative and heartfelt examination of a beautiful landscape and its fauna.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A quiet but rousing call to action for anyone who loves the natural world and wants to help preserve it.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Sunday Telegraph</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Compelling. A tour de force of forensic observation and imaginative reconstruction. The prose carries a deep, rich polish.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Spectator</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Exquisitely observed and deeply evocative,&nbsp;<em>Gods of the Morning</em>&nbsp;is a joyful affirmation of the changing seasons, the wonders of wildlife, and the value of living close to nature. Generous, poetic, and wise.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Patrick Barkham, author of 'Badgerlands'</strong></p><h2>Jacob&#39;s Room</h2><p><p>The story is told mainly through the perspectives of the women in Jacob's life, including the repressed upper-middle-class Clara Durrant and the uninhibited young art student Florinda, with whom he has an affair. His time in London forms a large part of the story, though towards the end of the novel he travels to Italy and then Greece. </p><p>The novel centres, in a very ambiguous way, around the life story of the protagonist Jacob Flanders and is presented almost entirely through the impressions other characters have of Jacob. Thus, although it could be said that the book is primarily a character study and has little in the way of plot or background, the narrative is constructed with a void in place of the central character if, indeed, the novel can be said to have a 'protagonist' in conventional terms. Motifs of emptiness and absence haunt the novel and establish its elegiac feel. Jacob is described to us, but in such indirect terms that it would seem better to view him as an amalgam of the different perceptions of the characters and narrator. He does not exist as a concrete reality, but rather as a collection of memories and sensations.</p><p>Motifs of emptiness and absence haunt the novel and establish its elegiac feel.

Ducat shows the link between the desperate macho strutting of male politicians, the gender gap in voting behavior, and fundamentalist holy wars. He argues that a direct association exists between the magnitude of a man's femiphobia-that is, his terror of being perceived as feminine-and his tendency to embrace right-wing political opinions.<br><br>From the strenuous efforts by handlers to counter George H. W. Bush's "wimp factor" to the swaggering arrogance that led to the moral and military quagmire in U.S.-occupied Iraq, anxious masculinity has been a discernible subtext in politics. Ducat shows how this anxiety has been an underlying force in public life throughout the history of Western culture, and also explores why and how certain political issues get gendered. Analyzing various aspects of popular culture and drawing on pioneering research on the gender gap, <i>The Wimp Factor</i> is a fascinating expos� that will alter our understanding of contemporary politics.</p><p>Stephen J. Ducat is professor of psychology at the School of Humanities at New College of California, a licensed clinical psychologist in private practice, and a candidate at the Psychoanalytic Institute of Northern California. He lives in the San Francisco Bay area.Just as George Herbert Walker Bush announced his candidacy for president in October 1987, the cover of Newsweek pegged him with the emasculating headline "Fighting the Wimp Factor"-a line that clinical psychologist Ducat (Taken In) says put the candidate, his handlers and eventually his son, George W., on the defensive for the next decade and a half. Bush's patrician habits-from asking for a "splash more coffee" at a New Hampshire truck stop to using effete expressions like "dippity do," "darn" and "heck"-would soon be replaced with a (strained) Real Man From Texas image. But if the senior Bush never quite convinced the public, or his own party, that he was anything more than a Connecticut WASP who used "summer" as a verb, Ducat argues that the Republicans had their revenge when the younger Bush won the presidency largely because he was able to convince voters that he was a regular guy, a true Texan. In this insightful analysis of the role male fear plays in politics, Ducat provides in-depth examples of the emotions that may have fueled the Right's attacks on Hillary Rodham Clinton and its animosity towards Bill Clinton. He stumbles a little when he uses his own minimal research to analyze men's psychological reactions to the Persian Gulf War but, overall, Ducat lays out a cogent theory for the motivations behind the good ole boy defense mechanisms. Though this book does preach to the converted, its fresh and complex insights may reach a new generation of swing voters.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Sigerist was uniquely qualified to attempt such a vast task--trained in medicine and the social sciences, master of fourteen languages, at the time of his death in 1957 he was already recognized as the foremost medical historian of this century.

Highlighting the complex and changing nature of economic activity, this wide-ranging text employs a pragmatic mix of old and new methods to examine the role of values and theoretical beliefs in economic life and in economists&#x2019; understanding of it. It attends to the problems which have come with high productivity, rapidly changing technology and skills, changing proportions of earning and non-earning years in most people&#x2019;s lives, and a faltering revolution in childhood and parenting which has brought stress and over-work for many women. It addresses such issues as rising poverty, inequality, insecurity and the slow progress of environmental reform. In focusing on such abuses of affluence the text draws on institutional, Keynesian, green and feminist theories, while emphasising all approaches to understanding economic life.</p><p>Hugh Stretton studied law and classics at Melbourne University, history at Oxford University, and economics as a visiting fellow at Princeton University.

This book helps families set and achieve the goals necessary for developing eight essential character traits: integrity, faith, a teachable spirit, a servant's heart, self-discipline, joy, compassion, and courage.<br> The Yateses use stories and practical examples from their lives and the lives of their five children to show how character can be purposefully cultivated through the normal, daily events in life. With refreshing honesty, they share how parents and children can grow together in these qualities. <i>Character Matters!</i> includes focus questions and three appendices, including a leader's guide for group study.</p><p>How can you equip your children to live a life of integrity before God and in service to others? <br><br>Developing a character that stands firm is not something that happens automatically. As a parent, you need goals for character development and practical ways of achieving those goals. Character Matters! is the essential resource to guide you in this ongoing process. <br><br>John and Susan Yates describe how both parents and children can intentionally grow in character through the normal, daily events in life. They highlight eight essential character traits-integrity, faith, a teachable spirit, a servant's heart, self-discipline, joy, compassion, and courage-and give insight into God's perspective on each. <br><br>Through stories and practical examples, the Yateses share how they seek to develop these traits in their own lives and in the lives of their five children. By seeing how to use everyday circumstances as opportunities for character development, you'll discover that often the big lessons in life are best learned in the little, everyday issues. <br><br>"Here's a biblical plan for raising secure, loving children-a book you need to read!"

He also carried with him a leather-trimmed journal to record his travels and notes on his activities.<br>In this vivid history, Jo Ann Trogdon reveals William Clark&#x2019;s highly questionable activities during the years before his famous journey west of the Mississippi. Delving into the details of Clark&#x2019;s diary and ledger entries, Trogdon investigates evidence linking Clark to a series of plots&#x2014;often called the Spanish Conspiracy&#x2014;in which corrupt officials sought to line their pockets with Spanish money and to separate Kentucky from the United States. <b><i>The Unknown Travels and Dubious Pursuits of William Clark</i></b> gives readers a more complex portrait of the American icon than has been previously written.<br></p><p><p>Attorney Jo Ann Trogdon lives in Columbia, Missouri, the same city where the 1798-1801 journal of William Clark has been housed, virtually overlooked, in the State Historical Society of Missouri since 1928. She was led to the journal by her research in Spanish archives for her book, <i>St. Charles Borromeo: 200 Years of Faith</i>. Her articles on history have appeared in publications including <i>Arizona Highways</i> and <i>We Proceeded On</i>, a publication of the Lewis and Clark Trail Heritage Foundation.</p>&#x201c;This study by Jo Ann Trogdon is refreshing because it goes beyond the repeated details of the Lewis and Clark famous exposition of America from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast, and instead asks, who was William Clark before this point and why Meriwether Lewis chose him for this adventurous journey when he probably had the funding to attract almost any of the experienced explorers from the period. And instead of running through Clark&#x2019;s life, a feat that has already been attempted, Trogdon chose a little-explored voyage that holds intriguing mysteries.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Pennsylvania Literary Journal</i><br><br>&#x201c;At times reading like a complex spy novel, this is an excellent book on an obscure event in the early history of the Republic.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The NYMAS Review</i><br><br>&#x201c;A serious reference for any scholar of American history.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Foreword</i><br><br>&#x201c;For anyone who loves historical detection, this is truly a stellar read and a worthy addition to the bookshelf for continued reference.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Historia Obscura</i><br><br>&#x201c;With Meriwether Lewis, William Clark led an epic expedition that captured the young nation&#x2019;s imagination and prompted talk of its expansion across the continent. That was in 1804. Six years earlier, however, Clark had been associating with those who sought to diminish the United States.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The Kansas City Star</i><br><br>&#x201c;Thanks to Wilkinson&#x2019;s and the Spanish administrations&#x2019; skillful cover-ups after Wilkinson&#x2019;s betrayal of Aaron Burr, and the obscurity of William&#x2019;s 1798 journal, the young hero seems to have dodged a scandal that could have ruined his career.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Indiana Magazine of History</i><br><br>&#x201c;Trogdon provides a splendid context of the swirling complexities and intrigues permeating Spanish Louisiana and New Orleans a few years before Jefferson&#x2019;s diplomats arranged for the purchase of the Louisiana Territory.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>We Proceeded On</i><br><br>&#x201c;Well-written, referenced, and researched. The book is an invaluable text for scholars and is one of the most detailed examinations of William Clark&#x2019;s life during the 1790s to date. Moreover, because the Spanish payoff and the other machinations involved are so foreign to today&#x2019;s readers, this book is also a history of Spanish-American relations from the period, and other historical events, personages, and locations relevant to the story are also fully explored.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Le Journal, Center for French Colonial Studies</i><br><br> &#x201c;Trogdon is especially generous with minute details, ranging from the effects of a yellow-fever outbreak on the street lighting in Philadelphia and the techniques of land surveying, to the array of creature comforts available in a swank Baltimore hotel.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Gateway</i>, the magazine of the Missouri History Museum<br><br> &#x201c;Imaginative historical detection and good writing will make this a widely read and much discussed book. Trogdon&#x2019;s surprising discoveries point to Clark&#x2019;s apparent involvement in a tangled web of conspiracy involving a foreign power. This thought-provoking book illustrates the potential rewards of curiosity and painstaking research in out-of-the-way places.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>William E. Foley</b>, author of <i>Wilderness Journey: The Life of William Clark</i><br><br> &#x201c;William Clark became famous for the journey he co-led to the Pacific. But his New Orleans journey of 1798 is important in its own right. Not only did it hone his travel and cartography skills for the epic Lewis and Clark Expedition and play an important part in its success, but it placed the explorer on the historical stage as a player in a turbulent time in American history with schemes and shifting alliances that potentially threatened the stability, growth, and very future of the young United States. Did fortune smile on William Clark that he was never identified as part of the cabal scheming to separate Kentucky from the Union? Was he ever a party to such scheming and possible treason?&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>James J.

What&#x2019;s the story behind these books?</b> <br> Wiley Publishing is releasing three new books of mine, <i>Creative Close-Ups: Digital Photography Tips &amp; Techniques</i> , <i>Creative Night: Digital Photography Tips &amp; Techniques</i> , and <i>Creative Composition: Digital Photography Tips &amp; Techniques</i> . My idea with these books was to help people become better photographers by presenting the subject of digital photography in a different way. <p></p> <p></p> <b>What&#x2019;s different about your approach?</b> <br> They say that cameras don&#x2019;t take photos, people do. It&#x2019;s really true. Someone with a great eye can take masterful photos with an inexpensive camera. Therefore, it is important to know something about photo technique, but the really amazing thing is that we can conceptualize and come up with these bits and bytes that make up a photo&#x2014;and they can be meaningful to people. I try to help people come up with images that are relevant and meaningful. Cameras and hardware are just tools. <p></p> <b>What&#x2019;s with all the photos in these books?</b> <br> Well, everyone likes to look at striking images, so one thing my photos do in these books is get people&#x2019;s attention. However, the photos play another role as well. Each photo in my book is accompanied by the story of how the photo was made and the technical data related to the photo. That way, if you&#x2019;re not ready to dive into the text itself, you can learn a lot just by browsing the photos. <p></p> My feeling is that you truly do learn about photography by looking at photos. It&#x2019;s much more important to look at images you admire and try and figure out why you like them than it is to read about photography. The photos in these books are baked into the DNA of the teaching strategy. By browsing through the pages, someone can learn a great deal and have an enjoyable visual experience at the same time. <p></p> <b>What&#x2019;s the most important thing that readers can get out of your new books?</b> <br> I want to inspire readers to be the most creative and best photographers they can be. If you pick up one of my books, I hope you can make use of the technical content and see how the photos relate to some of your own work. The most important thing, however, is to take the ideas in the book, get out there, and do some really peddle-to-the-metal creative photography. <p></p><p>Creative Night</p> <p>Digital Photography Tips &amp; Techniques</p> <p>Harold Davis</p> <p>Creative Night</p> <p>Digital Photography Tips &amp; Techniques</p> <p>The night is an uncharted universe filled with surprisingly rich color, texture, and mood &#x2014; just waiting to be captured by your digital camera.

The association is not surprising to Elizabeth L. Eisenstein, for from its very early days the printing press was viewed by some as black magic. For the most part, however, it was welcomed as a "divine art" by Western churchmen and statesmen. Sixteenth-century Lutherans hailed it for emancipating Germans from papal rule, and seventeenth-century English radicals viewed it as a weapon against bishops and kings. While an early colonial governor of Virginia thanked God for the absence of printing in his colony, a century later, revolutionaries on both sides of the Atlantic paid tribute to Gutenberg for setting in motion an irreversible movement that undermined the rule of priests and kings. Yet scholars continued to praise printing as a peaceful art. They celebrated the advancement of learning while expressing concern about information overload.</p><p>In <i>Divine Art, Infernal Machine</i>, Eisenstein, author of the hugely influential <i>The Printing Press as an Agent of Change</i>, has written a magisterial and highly readable account of five centuries of ambivalent attitudes toward printing and printers. Once again, she makes a compelling case for the ways in which technological developments and cultural shifts are intimately related. Always keeping an eye on the present, she recalls how, in the nineteenth century, the steam press was seen both as a giant engine of progress and as signaling the end of a golden age. Predictions that the newspaper would supersede the book proved to be false, and Eisenstein is equally skeptical of pronouncements of the supersession of print by the digital.</p><p>The use of print has always entailed ambivalence about serving the muses as opposed to profiting from the marketing of commodities. Somewhat newer is the tension between the perceived need to preserve an ever-increasing mass of texts against the very real space and resource constraints of bricks-and-mortar libraries. Whatever the multimedia future may hold, Eisenstein notes, our attitudes toward print will never be monolithic. For now, however, reports of its death are greatly exaggerated.</p></p><p>Elizabeth L. Eisenstein is Professor Emerita of History at the University of Michigan. In addition to The Printing Press as an Agent of Change, her books include its abridgment, The Printing Revolution in Early Modern Europe, and Grub Street Abroad: Aspects of the French Cosmopolitan Press from the Age of Louis XIV to the French Revolution.<p>"Eisenstein's research is impressive, reaching far and wide across languages and centuries. Her knowledge of the history of publication engages the wealth of recent scholarship and extends as far back as Roman copyists. . . . Her breadth enables her to identify topoi and their mutations; to observe long-term trends, diminishing ripples, and delayed reactions; and to distinguish what is new or newly dressed in authors' concerns and readers' complaints."&#x2014;<i>Journal of Scholarly Publishing</i></p></p><h2>Italian Demystified (Italian and English Edition)</h2><p><p><b>Lick your Italian-language problems with DeMYSTiFieD!</b></p> <p>Want to get into Italian but don't know where to start?

Her book challenges the conventional wisdom that the post-World War II "multiversity" was created by military patrons on the one hand and academic scientists on the other and points instead to the crucial role played by university administrators in making their universities dependent upon military, foundation, and industrial patronage.<br><br>Contesting the view that the "federal grant university" originated with the outpouring of federal support for science after the war, Lowen shows how the Depression had put financial pressure on universities and pushed administrators to seek new modes of funding. She also details the ways that Stanford administrators transformed their institution to attract patronage.<br><br>With the end of the cold war and the tightening of federal budgets, universities again face pressures not unlike those of the 1930s.

He later said that he had "learned more in those two years than in any other equal part of his life." <em>The Ring of Words</em> reveals how his professional work on the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> influenced Tolkien's creative use of language in his fictional world. <br> Here three senior editors of the OED offer an intriguing exploration of Tolkien's career as a lexicographer and illuminate his creativity as a word user and word creator. The centerpiece of the book is a wonderful collection of "word studies" which will delight the heart of Ring fans and word lovers everywhere. The editors look at the origin of such Tolkienesque words as "hobbit," "mithril, "Smeagol," "Ent," "halfling," and "worm" (meaning "dragon"). Readers discover that a word such as "mathom" (anything a hobbit had no immediate use for, but was unwilling to throw away) was actually common in Old English, but that "Mithril," on the other hand, is a complete invention (and the first "Elven" word to have an entry in the OED). And fans of Harry Potter will be surprised to find that "Dumbledore" (the name of Hogwart's headmaster) was a word used by Tolkien and many others (it is a dialect word meaning "bumblebee"). <br> Few novelists have found so much of their creative inspiration in the shapes and histories of words. Presenting archival material not found anywhere else, <em>The Ring of Words</em> offers a fresh and unexplored angle on the literary achievements of one of the world's most famous and best-loved writers.</p><p><br><strong>Peter Gilliver</strong> is an Associate Editor of the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> and is also working on a history of the <em>OED</em>. <strong>Jeremy Marshall</strong> is an Associate Editor of the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> and co-author of <em>Questions of English</em>. <strong>Edmund Weiner</strong> is Deputy Chief Editor of the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em>. He has written several books on English grammar and usage and teaches an annual course in the history of English.<br><br>"The connection between his time spent mired in the drudgery of lexicography, his deeply felt and lifelong passion for philology, and the consequent meticulous craftsmanship of his writing, is all impeccably demonstrated in this fascinating assessment of Tolkien's life as one of England's most distinguished wordwrights. Anyone enthralled by the story of the English language will be captivated by this account of an unforgettable man's half-forgotten first achievements."--Simon Winchester, author of <em>The Professor and the Madman</em> and <em>The Meaning of Everything: The Story of the Oxford English</em> <em>Dictionary</em><p></p><br>"Tolkien the scholar of language and Tolkien the author of fantasy fiction were inseparable: the authors explore this subject further than has been done before. But it is their extensive notes on the etymology and meaning of individual words used by Tolkien which readers will welcome most. <em>The Ring</em> <em>of Words</em> is an excellent addition to the shelf of best books about Tolkien, warmly recommended."--Wayne G. Hammond, author of <em>J.R.R.

Yet many of us are feeling anything but fulfilled and free. Across generational lines, inside the church and out, we are understanding that we have lost the beauty and wonder of our distinctive makeup and calling as women. We are realizing that what was supposed to lift us up has been tearing down society, churches, and most importantly, our own families.</p> <p>There is now a new movement spreading its seeds--seeds of hope, humility, obedience, and prayer. It is a call to return to godly womanhood, and it is resonating in the hearts of women everywhere.</p> <p>Let its truth ring in your heart through the powerful messages of these seven beloved teachers: Nancy Leigh DeMoss, Susan Hunt, Mary A. Kassian, Carolyn Mahaney, Barbara Hughes, P. Bunny Wilson, and Dorothy Patterson. They approach the subject of womanhood from different angles and teaching styles, but throughout there runs a thread. One that will instill itself in your spirit. A thread of joy and delight with the greatness of God's created order and the part He wants you to play in His grand redemptive plan.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Four Pillars of Healing: How the New Integrated Medicine- -the Best of Conventional and Alternative Approaches- - Can Cure You</h2><p>Dr. Leo Galland, along with Doctors Bernie Siegel and Andrew Weil, has been a key architect in the emerging field of integrated medicine, which combines the best of alternative and orthodox treatments. He is also a renowned medical detective, successfully curing patients whose illnesses have defied prior diagnosis and treatment. In his new book, The Four Pillars of Healing, he shares the breakthrough medical philosophy and program of healing he has developed over the course of three decades of education and practice.<br><br>If you've ever heard yourself referred to in your doctor's office as "the chest pain in Room Three,"&nbsp;&nbsp;you know that most doctors regard patients as the sum of their symptoms and treat them accordingly: identify the symptoms, name the disease, and try to cure it. Yet you know intuitively that no two people with the same diagnosis respond to treatment in the same way. So why focus on the disease instead of the person? Dr. Galland argues for a fundamental change in this one-size-fits-all philosophy of disease and proposes instead patient-centered diagnosis, viewing each patient as a unique individual and equal participant in treatment.<br><br>Dr. Galland explains how to work closely with your doctor through patient-centered diagnosis to identify the mediators, triggers, and antecedents of your illness. A mediator is anything that produces your symptoms, causes damage to your body, or changes your behavior. As Dr. Galland reveals, mediators need not be merely biochemical (e.g., stress hormones)--how we think and feel can mediate our illness. A trigger is anything that provokes a mediator. Triggers range from the physical (infections, drugs, toxins) to the cognitive (social distress, anxiety, even memories of previous sickness). An antecedent is a risk factor that predisposes you to illness, such as your genetics, age, and even learning and conditioning.<br><br>Drawing on fascinating case histories of medical detection to illustrate these principles, Dr. Galland guides you in identifying your own mediators, triggers, and antecedents, then teaches you how to implement the four pillars of healing to overcome illness and achieve optimum health. The pillars are:<br><br>building healthy relationships (community is the most powerful healing force)<br>creating a customized prescription for diet, rest, and exercise<br>purifying your external environment<br>detoxifying your internal environment to help your body protect and cleanse itself.<br>Eloquently written and filled with practical advice about detecting the unsuspected causes of our sicknesses, building resistance to disease, and harnessing our own bodies' natural desire to heal, Dr. Galland's innovative book represents mind/body medicine at its best. For anyone whose illness hasn't responded to treatment or resists diagnosis, or who craves a higher level of health, The Four Pillars of Healing is essential reading.</p><p>"The medicine of the future will embrace and integrate the best of conventional and alternative approaches to health and healing. In <b>The Four Pillars of Healing</b>, Dr. Leo Galland writes compassionately and convincingly of the importance of treating patients as individuals. He makes a compelling argument that sickness is most effectively treated when the particular needs and underlying psychosocial, emotional, and environmental issues are also addressed. <br>-- Dean Ornish, M.D., author of <b>Dr. Dean Ornish's Program for Reversing Heart Disease</b><p>"An excellent, well-written practical resource. If you care about your state of health, you will want to read it."<br>-- Bernie S. Siegel, M.D., author of <b>Love, Medicine &amp; Miracles</b></p><p>"Dr. Galland's invaluable advice has been a great help to me. I'm delighted that others will at last have the benefit of his wisdom in their search for healing."<br>-- Carol Burnett</p>Leo Galland, M.D., received his undergraduate degree at Harvard University and his medical training at New York University and Bellevue Hospital. Dr. Galland served as director of medical research at the Gesell Institute for Human Development. His private practice in New York specializes in treating undiagnosed or difficult-to-treat illnesses. Dr. Galland is a pioneer of integrated medicine, combining the best of alternative and orthodox approaches.</p><h2>Radiance: A Novel</h2><p>Somewhere in California, in the 1990s, a nuclear weapons lab develops advanced technologies for its post-Cold War mission. Advanced as in <i>not working</i> <i>yet</i>. Mission as in <i>continued funding</i>. A scandal-plagued missile defense program presses forward, dragging physicist Philip Quine deep into the machinations of those who would use the lab for their own gain.<br><br>The Soviet Union has collapsed. But new enemies are sought, and new reasons found to continue the work that has legitimized the power of the Lab, its mangers, and the politicians who fund them. Quine is thrust into the center of programs born at the intersection of paranoia, greed, and ambition, and torn by incommensurable demands. Deadlines slip and cost overruns mount. He is drawn into a maelstrom of policy meetings, classified documents, petty betrayals, interrupted conservations, missed meanings, unanswered voicemail, stolen data, and pornographic files. Amid all the noise and static of the late twentieth century made manifest in weapons and anti-weapons, human beings have set in motion a malign a d inhuman reality, which now is beyond their control. <br><br>More than critique of corrupt science and a permanent wartime economy, <i>Radiance</i> is a novel of lost ideals, broken aspirations, and human costs. In this vivid satire, relationship are just a question of who's using whom. Failure is just another word for opportunity. "Spin" is a property not of atomic particles but if the news cycle. Nature is a blur beyond the windshield, where lives are spent on the road, on the phone, on the make, in fierce competition for financial, political, and intellectual resources.<br></p><p>Carter Scholz has made a difficult subject highly relevant and entertaining with <i>Radiance</i>, his debut novel investigating the darkness at the heart of the nuclear defense industry. With the eye of an insider, Scholz focuses this daring work on a California nuclear testing lab in the mid-1990s and declassifies the motivations and manipulations of its senior planners. The novel follows Philip Quine, a reluctant weapons research scientist whose whistle-blowing report on lab data falsification leads to his promotion as interim lab director. As Quine gradually discovers the defense industry's deep-seated deceptions and self-sustaining tactics, the novel turns its attention to human nature and the unspoken drives and fears that propel us to contention. <p> An excellent novel on all counts, <i>Radiance</i> succeeds most notably due to Scholz's extensive research and use of detail. He provides plenty of complex scientific information, and in his hands it's accessible and fascinating. A gallery of well-developed characters helps dramatize the novel's revelations and illuminate the varying backgrounds and beliefs of those influencing defense policy. A part-time composer of electronic music, Scholz has an ear for dialogue and sound, which is made evident by his musical prose and use of realistic punctuation. Intricate and dark, <i>Radiance</i> is saturated with fragmented transmissions, signs, and conversations that may well resemble puzzle pieces. Where these puzzle pieces intersect we see an intertwining of fates and a bleak future. On the other hand, all that information could just be minutiae distracting us from the obvious and unavoidable. Either way, it's one more reason to investigate <i>Radiance</i>. <i>--Ross Doll</i></p>Carter Scholz has been publishing short fiction for 25 years.

Perec&#39;s first novel won the Prix Renaudot and became the cult book for a generation. In &#34;A Man Asleep&#34;, a young student embarks upon a disturbing and exhaustive pursuit of indifference, following his experience in non-existence with relentless logic.</p><p>Georges Perec (1936-82) won the Prix Renaudot in 1965 for his first novel Things: A Story of the Sixties, and went on to exercise his unrivalled mastery of language in almost every imaginable kind of writing, from the apparently trivial to the deeply personal. He composed acrostics, anagrams, autobiography, criticism, crosswords, descriptions of dreams, film scripts, heterograms, lipograms, memories, palindromes, plays, poetry, radio plays, recipes, riddles, stories short and long, travel notes, univocalics, and, of course, novels. <i>Life: A User's Manual</i>, which draws on many of Perec's other works, appeared in 1978 after nine years in the making and was acclaimed a masterpiece to put beside Joyce's <i>Ulysses.</i> It won the Prix Medicis and established Perec's international reputation.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>The Disorder of Women: Democracy, Feminism, and Political Theory</h2><p>Carole Pateman is one of the leading political theorists writing today. This wide-ranging volume brings together for the first time a selection of her work on democratic theory and feminist criticism of mainstream political theory. The volume includes substantial discussions of problems of democracy, citizenship and the welfare state, including the largely unrecognized difficulties surrounding women&#39;s participation. The inclusion of essays from both a mainstream and feminist perspective provides concrete examples of the differences between these two approaches to democracy, to questions of consent and political obligation, and to the relationship between the private and public spheres. This scholarly and highly challenging work will be of interest to students and researchers in political theory, political science, women&#39;s studies and sociology.</p><p>This volume includes substantial discussions of problems of democracy, citizenship and the welfare state, including the largely unrecognized difficulties surrounding women&#39;s participation.Carole Pateman is Reader in Government at the University of Sydney.

The most extensive study of Nevelson to be published in over&nbsp;20 years, this beautifully illustrated book also demonstrates how Nevelson&#x2019;s flamboyant style and carefully cultivated persona enhanced her reputation as an artist of the first rank.<br>Essays by distinguished scholars examine a wide variety of important issues and themes throughout Nevelson&#x2019;s career, including the role of monochromatic color in her painted wooden sculpture; the art-historical context of her work; her acclaimed large-scale commissioned artworks, which established her as a central figure in the public art revival of the late 1960s; and her self-fashioning&#x201d; as a celebrated artist, particularly her origins as a Ukrainian-born Jewish immigrant to the United States. An illustrated chronology and exhibition history accompany the text.<br>Published in conjunction with the first major exhibition of Nevelson&#x2019;s work in America since 1980, this book provides essential information on and insights into the study of a revolutionary 20th-century artist.</p><p><p><b>Brooke Kamin Rapaport </b>is a curator and writer. <b>Arthur C.

Commanding in her dramatic scarves and robes, mink coats, and extravagant false eyelashes, the artist herself was a work of living sculpture. A pioneer in installation art, Nevelson transformed the humblest of materials, wood scraps, into intricate constructions with the complexity of cellular architecture. So powerful were Nevelson's finely detailed black, white, and gold room-filling wood sculptures, she was commissioned to create large outdoor works and built remarkably airy steel structures. But after her death in 1988, Nevelson was forgotten. Now, finally, she is reclaimed as the visionary she was in this suitably dazzling overview in which Rapaport and her superb contributors, including Arthur C. Danto, match measured biography with judicious critical commentary and superb photographs. Given to oracular and contradictory pronouncements, Nevelson herself remains a riddle. But her daring and transfiguring work, which finds beauty and value in the broken and the cast-off, speaks a universal language. The world is a richer place with Nevelson back in view. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In the Arab world, neither before nor since has another Western intellectual been so widely translated, debated, and celebrated.<br> &nbsp;<br> By closely following the remarkable career of Arab existentialism, Yoav Di-Capua reconstructs the cosmopolitan milieu of the generation that tried to articulate a political and philosophical vision for an egalitarian postcolonial world. He tells this story by touring a fascinating selection of Arabic and Hebrew archives, including unpublished diaries and interviews. Tragically, the warm and hopeful relationships forged between Arab intellectuals, Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and others ended when, on the eve of the 1967 war, Sartre failed to embrace the Palestinian cause. Today, when the prospect of global ethical engagement seems to be slipping ever farther out of reach, <i>No Exit</i> provides a timely, humanistic account of the intellectual hopes, struggles, and victories that shaped the Arab experience of decolonization and a delightfully wide-ranging excavation of existentialism&#x2019;s non-Western history.</p><p><b>Yoav Di-Capua </b>is an associate professor of history at the University of Texas at Austin.<br> &nbsp;"A tour de force, <i>No Exit </i>provides an absorbing, sensitive, and yet complex and multi-stranded narrative of the sense of intellectual excitement and political frustration that marked Arab intellectuals' engagement with Sartre and existentialism in the 1960s. An exemplary exercise in global intellectual history and postcolonial studies." (<i>Dipesh Chakrabarty, University of Chicago</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;In an age when so many associate the Arab world with regressive faith and failed revolution, Yoav Di-Capua&#x2019;s brilliant study is a galvanizing reminder of its centrality to the history of one of the most vanguard intellectual movements of modern times. In a pathbreaking global intellectual history, Di-Capua reveals that Jean-Paul Sartre's celebrated depiction of &#x2018;no exit&#x2019; could take on tragic new meaning in postcolonial societies. It is an amazingly bold and ingenious accomplishment, crossing and uniting fields like no book I can remember.&#x201d; (<i>Samuel Moyn, Yale University</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;In a gripping narrative, Di-Capua unearths the vast terrain of Arab existentialism heretofore invisible. This important global intellectual history transforms our understanding of decolonization from the close of World War II to 1967, introducing readers to a generation of the Arab world&#x2019;s leading thinkers and how they sought to navigate the Cold War by translating existential ontology to suit their purposes. Scholars of existentialism, decolonization, racism, postcolonialism, the Cold War, and Middle East studies will find it of vital interest.&#x201d; (<i>Jonathan Judaken, Rhodes College</i>)<br><br>"The archive of Arab philosophers and litt�rateurs that <i>No Exit </i>makes available in English opens up a space for the historian as well as the postcolonial theorist to return to a moment of decolonial potential and its political-ideological stakes to glimpse acts of political commitment, articulation, hope, struggle, and, ultimately, betrayal that could have been otherwise and, yet, still have much to tell us today."

J.R. Hale not only records the events of 1480-1520, but also suggests what it was like to have lived in this period. He provides readers with an understanding of the quality of lives of people living at this time and includes processes and personalities not often covered by other books. For the second edition Professor Michael Mallet provides an updated bibliography and an extended introduction explaining the book's place in the historiography of the subject.<br> <br> The book is arranged thematically, each chapter designed to provide information about a specific field of inquiry and also give an insight into the people of this era. J. R. Hale investigates how these people felt about their environment and the passage of time; their relationships with government and other institutions, from the Church to the family; their economic frameworks; the part religion played in their lives; and what cultural and intellectual pursuits were available to them.<br> <br> Renaissance Europe compares our own attitudes to those of the Renaissance and vice versa, thereby enriching the readers understanding of everyday life in the past.</p><p><b>J.

Professor Hale died in 1999."Hale's picture of the years around 1500 is generally precise and not out-dated. He anticipated several areas of later writing, for example his emphasis on the history of the lower classes, on the impact of wars, on women's role in society, on social mobility among 'classes'.

Golden, Jeferson, Wisconsin<br><br>This is a collection of letters written by an illumined Eastern Orthtodox holy man who lived in the 20th century on the holy mountain of Athos in caves and huts. It is a book for those who want to go more deeply into the interior life of Christ, girded by the written instructions of an experienced guide and elder, without having to go outside the Christian tradition to do so. I am finding it an invaluable tool and motivation. One must understand however that it is a book by a monk and ascetic. Not all of what he instructs is practical or even possible for those of us who live in the world. But in the same way that one might read a book by Lance Armstrong on bicycle racing, without having any hope or possibility of achieving his level of accomplishment, this book will motivate and challenge you! --K. Allen, California<br><br>A real gem!

The simple story begins ``In a faraway forest, near a faraway mountain, it is a cold silent night.'' It is the compelling power of the colored woodcuts that will attract readers to this book; but on more careful consideration, readers will find that the text conveys the quiet sensitivity of haiku poetry which perfectly matches the Japanese woodcuts. The cold lavender and blue backgrounds and the stretch of shadows on the frozen snow add to the stillness of the place and the loneliness of the fox. The only other living creature seen in the forest is a snow hare who seems almost to bound from the page as the fox chases him, leaving the fox alone once more in a strange place. Looking at the frozen trees, he imagines ice animals in the branches. With the coming of morning, however, comes the promise of another springtime and a mate. Thus, the cyclical nature of the text leaves readers with both a sense of satisfaction and with the anticipation of promises yet to be fulfilled. This is a perfect read-aloud for the quiet contemplation of nature for, like all poetry, these words need to be heard as well as seen; and the illustrations are even more startling and powerful from across the room than they are close-up.

The only hint to this memorial for the 15th century Italian explorer, Amerigo Vespucci, is an apple resting on an outcropping of neon-green cement; of course the fact that the apple is not only artificial but has a bite taken out of it suggests otherwise to the discovery of these &#34;Edenic&#34; continents. This slight yet important fact raises the basic conceit of if i did it: the active disavowal of art&#39;s political function as a museological testament to the &#34;progress&#34; of social history. By tossing off this monumental propensity, Harrison builds &#34;antimonuments;&#34; not so much sculptures but lumpen aggregates of pop psychology. In addition to Vespucci, throughout the book, one finds that celebrities Johnny Depp and Tiger Woods are included in a pantheon with John Locke and 18th century Corsican revolutionary Pasquale Paoli, meanwhile Al Gore checks the temperature, Claude Levi-Strauss checks the door with a taxidermied hen and rooster and a bi-curious Alexander the Great is the master of ceremonies. The title, taken from O.J. Simpson&#39;s infamous &#34;hypothetical&#34; account of his murder of Nicole Brown Simpson and Donald Goldman, groups this role call of high- and low- brow idols into a nonhierarchical tableau where cultural and political value are allotted only where one sees fit.</p><p></p><h2>Optimization of Chemical Processes (MCGRAW HILL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SERIES)</h2><p>This is a text for both students and professionals, covering both theory and practice of optimization.

In reconstructing their own passage into adulthood, the writers inevitably tell the story of their country&#39;s turbulent journey from colonial subjugation through revolution to independence. Susan Rodgers&#39;s perceptive introduction illuminates the importance of autobiography in developing historical consciousness and imagining a national future.</p><p><b>Susan Rodgers</b> is Associate Professor of Anthropology at Holy Cross College and coeditor, most recently, of <i>Indonesian Religions in Transition</i> (1987).Text: English (translation)</p><h2>Dawn Wind</h2><p>The boy lay in the silence of the great battlefield, gazing at his own hand spread on the ground beside him. The hand moved and he realized, with something like surprise, that he was not dead. His name was Owain and further up the hillside lay his father and brother, both killed by Saxon warriors in that last great battle of Aquae Sulis. <br><br>From that moment Owain knows that he must make his own way in the world and so begins his journey to face the many challenges that lie ahead. <br><br>Rosemary Sutcliff is one of the greatest writers of historical fiction and<em> Dawn Wind</em> is an acclaimed and much-loved classic tale which will enthral readers old and new. This stunning new edition features the evocative original black and white illustrations by award-winning artist, Charles Keeping, which bring the story vividly to life.</p><p>Rosemary Sutcliff was born in Surrey, the daughter of a naval officer. At the age of two she contracted the progressively wasting Still's disease and spent most of her life in a wheelchair. Apart from reading, she made little progress at school and left at fourteen to attend art school,<br>specializing in miniature painting. In the 1940s she exhibited her first miniature in the Royal Academy and was elected a member of the Royal Society of Miniature Painters just after the war. In 1950 her first children's book, The Queen's Story, was published and from then on she devoted her time to<br>writing the children's historical novels which have made her such an esteemed and highly respected name in the field of children's literature. She received an OBE in the 1975 Birthday Honour's List and a CBE in 1992. Rosemary Sutcliff died at the age of 72 in 1992.&#34;First published in 1961, this reprint keeps its original charm by reproducing the black and white illustrations of Charles Keeping.

Maier looks at the turning points in East Germany's forty-year history and at the mix of coercion and consent by which the regime functioned. He analyzes the GDR as it evolved from the purges of the 1950s to the peace movements and emerging youth culture of the 1980s, and then turns his attention to charges of Stasi collaboration that surfaced after 1989. In the context of describing the larger collapse of communism, Maier analyzes German elements that had counterparts throughout the Soviet bloc, including its systemic and eventually terminal economic crisis, corruption and privilege in the SED, the influence of the Stasi and the plight of intellectuals and writers, and the slow loss of confidence on the part of the ruling elite. He then discusses the mass protests and proliferation of dissident groups in 1989, the collapse of the ruling party, and the troubled aftermath of unification.</p><br><br><p> <i>Dissolution</i> is the first book that spans the communist collapse and the ensuing process of unification, and that draws on newly available archival documents from the last phases of the GDR, including Stasi reports, transcripts of Politburo and Central Committee debates, and papers from the Economic Planning Commission, the Council of Ministers, and the office files of key party officials. This book is further bolstered by Maier's extensive knowledge of European history and the Cold War, his personal observations and conversations with East Germans during the country's dramatic transition, and memoirs and other eyewitness accounts published during the four-decade history of the GDR.</p></p><p>Fewer than ten years ago, a great wall divided Eastern and Western Europe. When it came crashing down in Germany in 1989, Charles S. Maier writes, the residents of the East suddenly found the rules that had governed their lives utterly changed. It could not have been otherwise, for the old rules were no good in &#34;a society breaking down, a regime out of touch with its society.&#34; Maier pokes into the nooks and crannies of recent history, showing how earthshaking changes can overtake us all unawares, and he traces the course of Communism&#39;s fall through a series of complex causes that can ultimately be ascribed to the usual human weaknesses: greed, ambition, corruption. His is an absorbing book that treats history as a sometimes puzzling morality play.<p>"Charles Maier is an historian whose writing talks both to political scientists and to lay readers no mean feat. Dissolution combines probing historical examination with disciplined and informed political analysis."--<b>Richard H. Ullman, Princeton University</b></p> <p>"Undoubtedly the most important survey of the GDR and its demise. Readers will find not only an engaging narrative of events but also coverage on broad topics ranging from an analysis of the 'old guard' to post-unification nostalgia. Throughout every facet of this book, we hear Maier's philosophically sophisticated 'voice' leading us through dilemmas created by values, economic realities, political clashes, and cultural ruptures."--<b>Claudia Koonz, Duke University</b></p> <p>"This is a beautifully written and insightful account of the collapse of the East German regime. It poses important general questions about inevitability and agency in history, and is especially good in analyzing the mood of the East German population itself. It is a wonderfully thoughtful book."--<b>Paul M. Kennedy, Yale University</b></p></p><h2>Philip of Spain</h2><p>Reassesses King Philip II&#39;s reputation as narrow-minded tyrant, describes the major events of his reign, and presents a more rounded depiction of his personality</p><p>This book, published four hundred years after Philip&#39;s death, is the first full-scale biography of the king. Placing him within the social, cultural, religious and regional context of his times, it presents a startling new picture of his character and reign. Drawing on Philip&#39;s unpublished correspondence and on many other archival sources, Henry Kamen reveals much about Philip the youth, the man, the husband, the father, the frequently troubled Christian and the king. Kamen finds that Philip was a cosmopolitan prince whose extensive experience of northern Europe broadened his cultural imagination and tastes, whose staunchly conservative ideas were far from being illiberal and fanatical, whose religious attitudes led him to accept a practical coexistence with Protestants and Jews, and whose support for Las Casas and other defenders of the Indians in America helped determine government policy. Shedding completely new light on most aspects of Philip&#39;s private life and, in consequence, on his public actions, this book is the definitive portrayal of Philip II.<b>Henry Kamen</b> has been professor of the Higher Council for Scientific Research in Barcelona since 1993. Before that he held various university posts in England and the United States. A Fellow of the Royal Historical Society, he is the author of several books on European and Spanish history, including <i>The Phoenix and the Flame: Catalonia and the Counter Reformation</i>, published by Yale University Press.<br></p><h2>Nation of Nations, Volume 2: Since 1865</h2><p>Known for its friendly narrative style and careful blending of political and social history, <i>Nation of Nations</i> offers a balanced approach to teaching the American history survey course.

As a result of this view, <i>Nation of Nations</i> has become the leader in the integration of global material, done in a sensible and thoughtful way.

European History Quarterly<br><br>"Bireley's study represents a major achievement. By providing a comprehensive, collective treatment to those supranational agents, the Jesuits, he has taken a hitherto neglected dimension for the study of the Thirty Years War and given it sustained, meaningful analysis and significant clarification for the period of Europe'sgestation and crisis." John M. Headley, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill<br><br>"In a tour de force of scholarship, Professor Bireley dispels the hoary myth of the Jesuits as a monolithic power behind the thrones of Europe's Catholic monarchs. His painstaking reconstruction of their activities in Madrid, Paris, Rome, Munich and Vienna demonstrates the considerable variations in both political intent and influence, not only between these great power centers, but also withing them. It also provides scholars with an invaluable trove of information about the great power diplomacy of the Thirty Years War." Charles Ingrao, Purdue University<br><br>"Bireley brings a fresh perspective to the study of the Thirty Years' War." H-FRANCE<br><br>"Jesuit confessors at the major courts of Catholic Europe during the Thirty Years War regularly corresponding with the Father General in Rome? This looks like a conspiracy. But instead the fascinating story that this magisterial book from the leading expert in the field reconstructs, after years of research in the archives of Europe, turns out to be one of conflicting personalities and loyalties-some promoting holy war, others intriguing for peace, and a Father General continuously arguing for more political restraint." Wolfgang Reinhard, Albert-Ludwigs- Universit"at Freiburg<br><br>"Birely's research is wide-ranging and meticulous, his narrative satisfying in its detail and his unique study will be of great value to research collections in history." Catholic Library World<br><br>"...this book is an outstanding synthesis of Bireley's historical interests." Central European History<br><br>"Bireley makes a valuable contribution to the diplomatic history of the Thirty Years War, and to the history of Catholic engagement with politics...All historians interested in religion and politics in the early modern era will find this book fascinating." - Canadian Journal of History, Erik Thomson, The University of Toronto<br><br>"...a work that will be consulted in the years to come as a definitive account on the subject, one that will be repeatedly referenced when new studies come out about the Jesuits and other religious orders in other areas of Europe.

But the eastern United States and maritime Canada, where dinosaurs also roamed in great numbers, have been equally important to the study of these extraordinary creatures. Some dinosaur fossils have come from the bog iron and clay pits of Maryland and New Jersey, while others have been discovered in the riverbanks of North and South Carolina. Dinosaur footprint sites have been found from central Virginia to the Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia.</p><p>In Dinosaurs of the East Coast, David Weishampel and Luther Young restore East Coast dinosaurs to their rightful place on the paleontological map. They describe such dinosaurs as the plant-eating Astrodon johnstoni, which browsed in a tropical Maryland jungle 100 million years ago; Anchisaurus polyzelus, which lived in New England some 200 million years ago; Eubrontes, the first large therapod on the East Coast; Pekinosaurus olseni, a primitive ornithischian found in North Carolina; and Hadrosaurus foulkii, a duck-billed dinosaur that lived in New Jersey some 70 million years ago. In addition, they chronicle the long and colorful history of dinosaur fossil hunting along the Atlantic coast and profile the modern-day fossil hunters -- both professional paleontologists and amateur collecters -- who continue to make important discoveries today. Richly illustrated with more than one hundred photographs and drawings, Dinosaurs of the East Coast combines science and history to offer a new look at an always fascinating subject.</p></p><p>In Dinosaurs of the East Coast David Weishampel and Luther Young restore East Coast dinosaurs to their rightful place on the paleontological map. They describe such dinosaurs as the plant-eating Astrodon johnstoni, similar to the Brachiosaurus, which browsed in a tropical Maryland jungle 100 million years ago. Other East Coast dinosaurs included a distant relative of Astrodon, Anchisaurus polyzelus, which lived in New England some 200 million years ago. And the remains of Hadrosaurus foulkii, a duck-billed dinosaur that lived in New Jersey some 70 million years ago, represented North America&#39;s first well-preserved dinosaur skeleton.

The original classic was the first compilation of the early integrative approaches and was hailed by one reviewer as "the bible of the integration movement." In the interim, psychotherapy integration has grown into a mature, empirically supported, and international movement. This second edition provides a state-of-the-art, comprehensive description of psychotherapy and its clinical practices by leading proponents. In addition to updates of all of the chapters, the new edition features: (1) eight new chapters covering topics such as cognitive-analytic therapy, integrative psychotherapy with culturally diverse clients, cognitive-behavioral analysis system, and blending spirituality with psychotherapy, (2) an entirely new section with two chapters on assimilative integration, (3) updated reviews of the empirical research on integrative and eclectic treatments, (4) chapter guidelines that facilitate comparative analyses and ensure comprehensiveness, and (5) a summary outline to help readers compare the integrative approaches. Blending the best of clinical expertise, empirical research, and theoretical pluralism, the revision of this "integration bible" will prove invaluable to practitioners, researchers, and students alike.<br></p><p><br><strong>John C.

Kertzer explains why ritual has been and will continue to be an essential part of political life. Weaving together examples from around the world and throughout history, Kertzer shows that the success of all political groups, whether conservative or revolutionary, is linked to their effective use of ritual.<br>&#x201c;The author delights the reader with numerous excursions into the political rites of the Aztecs, the contemporary Soviet Union, the French Revolution, colonial Africa, the Italian Communist Party, and a host of others, all richly and amusingly analyzed. . . . This is. . . political anthropology as it should be, directed at an interdisciplinary audience, and demonstrating to non-anthropologists the vital relevance of ethnographic comparison for political theory.&#x201d;&#x2015;Robert W. Hefner, <i>American Anthropologist<br></i>&#x201c;A major work in comparative political culture, this book should be mandatory reading for all undergraduate and graduate students of politics.&#x201d;&#x2015;<i>Choice<br></i>&#x201c;An important and compelling book, one that illuminates the role of ritual in human life, as well as the nature of politics. Written in a lucid and graceful style, it should appeal to the general reader as well as to anthropologists and political scientists.&#x201d;&#x2015;Charles E. Silberman, author of <i>A Certain People</i> and <i>Criminal Violence, Criminal Justice</i>.</p><p>Kertzer (anthropology, Bowdoin) credibly argues that political symbols manifested through rites explain much of the political life of modern nations, contrary to the usual rational, utilitarian, and interest-group explanations. He argues that rituals are not merely meaningful to the poorly educatedelites use rituals to support the existing order and revolutionaries use them to replace it. He provides numerous examples from primitive and modern societies (including the United States). The book will appeal to many political scientists and general readers. Although well documented, it avoids much of the vocabulary of academe. Recommended for academic and public libraries.

E. B. Du Bois from 1894 to early 1906. They show the first formulations of some of his most famous ideas, namely, &#x201c;the veil,&#x201d; &#x201c;double-consciousness,&#x201d; and the &#x201c;problem of the color line.&#x201d; Moreover, the deep historical sense of the formation of the modern world that informs Du Bois&#x2019;s thought and gave rise to his understanding of &#x201c;the problem of the color line&#x201d; is on display here. Indeed, the essays constitute an essential companion to Du Bois&#x2019;s masterpiece published in 1903 as The Souls of Black Folk.</p><p>The collection is based on two editorial principles: presenting the essays in their entirety and in strict chronological order. Copious annotation affords both student and mature scholar an unprecedented grasp of the range and depth of Du Bois&#x2019;s everyday intellectual and scholarly reference.</p><p>These essays commence at the moment of Du Bois&#x2019;s return to the United States from two years of graduate-level study in Europe at the University of Berlin. At their center is the moment of Du Bois&#x2019;s first full, self-reflexive formulation of a sense of vocation: as a student and scholar in the pursuit of the human sciences (in their still-nascent disciplinary organization&#x2015;that is, the institutionalization of a generalized &#x201c;sociology&#x201d; or general &#x201c;ethnology&#x201d;), as they could be brought to bear on the study of the situation of the so-called Negro question in the United States in all of its multiply refracting dimensions. They close with Du Bois&#x2019;s realization that the commitments orienting his work and intellectual practice demanded that he move beyond the institutional frames for the practice of the human sciences.</p><p>The ideas developed in these early essays remained the fundamental matrix for the ongoing development of Du Bois&#x2019;s thought. The essays gathered here will therefore serve as the essential reference for those seeking to understand the most profound registers of this major American thinker.</p></p><p>The book would be designed for teaching in the social sciences and humanities, in the hope of making better known the full depth and scope of Du Bois&#39;s contribution to thought.Nahum Dimitri Chandler serves on the faculty of the School of Humanities at the University of California, Irvine, in African American Studies, ComparativeLiterature, and European Languages and Studies.

During that period there have been a substantial number of changes in geotechnical engineering, especially in the applications of foundation engineering. As the world population increases, more land is needed and many soil deposits previously deemed unsuitable for residential housing or other construction projects are now being used. Such areas include problematic soil regions, mining subsidence areas, and sanitary landfills. To overcome the problems associated with these natural or man-made soil deposits, new and improved methods of analysis, design, and implementation are needed in foundation construction. As society develops and living standards rise, tall buildings, transportation facilities, and industrial complexes are increasingly being built. Because of the heavy design loads and the complicated environments, the traditional design concepts, construction materials, methods, and equipment also need improvement. Further, recent energy and material shortages have caused additional burdens on the engineering profession and brought about the need to seek alternative or cost-saving methods for foundation design and construction.</p><p></p><h2>The Collected Letters of Katherine Mansfield: Volume One: 1903-1917</h2><p>Gathers letters by the poet written to her husband, family, lovers, friends, and fellow writers prior to the onset of her tuberculosis</p><p>`admirable edition ... an important contribution to the Clarendon Press editions of literary correspondence.

Andy Warhol would complain, in the course of his daily trawl of antique stores, galleries, auction houses and flea markets. Though best known as an artist, Warhol was also a passionate and informed collector of unlikely antiquities and offbeat Americana. <i>Possession Obsession</i> proposes that collecting was another form of artistic practice for Warhol, certainly one that provides as much insight into his interests, tastes and ideas as his art. Accompanying essays examine the how, why, and what of Warhol's collection, the all-consuming role it played in his life, the aesthetic quality and historical associations of the objects themselves, the psychological and sexual aspects of collecting, other artists' use of collecting and the relationships between collecting and mass culture. Also included are Robert Mapplethorpe's wonderful photographs of Warhol's home, for which Patti Smith provides an introduction.</p><p>Andy Warhol started out as a very successful commercial illustrator, and became a painter, photographer, printmaker, film and video maker, magazine publisher, author, and celebrity. He had his first art show in 1962, at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles which showed his &#34;32 Campbell&#39;s Soup Cans.&#34; From that point on Warhol&#39;s work revolutionized the art world.This fascinating and visually exciting exhibition catalog reflects the more personal side of Andy Warhol's celebrity persona, that of the compulsive and obsessive collector. With a little help from Frederick Hughes and Jed Johnson, Warhol became a collector extraordinaire with an eye for everything from fine art to furniture to kitsch. This catalog chronicles the diversity of Warhol's obsession, based on the historic Sotheby's auction of his personal collection in April 1988. Essays by a range of contributors focus on Warhol's life as a collector, his important museum installations, and various collection genres. Highlighted are notable objects from art deco to Americana, including Native American and folk art, as well as jewelry and shoes, photographs and cookie jars, and his unique "time capsules." Edited by the archivist of the Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, the catalog is the perfect amalgamation of objects, ideas, events, and personalities.

Several years later this tale would be forever immortalized as &#x201c;Alice&#x2019;s Adventures in Wonderland.&#x201d; The story begins with Alice idly passing away the time next to a river when she sees a White Rabbit in a waistcoat with a pocket watch pass by. She follows the rabbit down the rabbit hole and ends up in the fantasy world of Wonderland. &#x201c;Alice&#x2019;s Adventures in Wonderland.&#x201d; is filled with a plethora of interesting and fantastical creatures. Along with the persistently tardy White Rabbit, Alice encounters a blue Caterpillar smoking a hookah, the mischievously grinning Cheshire Cat, a Mad Hatter, a March Hare, and a sleepy little Dormouse, whom she attends a tea party with, the King and Queen of Hearts, along with many other curious characters. Beloved my millions of children and adults ever since its first publication, &#x201c;Alice&#x2019;s Adventures in Wonderland&#x201d; is a classic tale of fantasy that has been cherished by readers ever since its first publication and will surely delight for many years to come. This edition is printed on premium acid-free paper and is illustrated by Arthur Rackham.</p><p>Lewis Carroll was the pen name of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, an English writer, mathematician, Anglican deacon, and photographer. Best known for his classics Alice s Adventures in Wonderland, Through the Looking Glass, and Jabberwocky, Carroll was also an accomplished inventor who created an early version of what is today known as Scrabble. The publication of Alice s Adventures in Wonderland in 1865 brought Carroll a certain level of fame, although he continued to supplement his income through his work as a mathematics tutor at Christ Church, Oxford College. Carroll s whimsical characters and nonsensical verse resonated with Victorian-era readers, and his books continue to be enjoyed by numerous modern societies dedicated to his promoting his works.</p><h2>Transcendence and the Concrete: Selected Writings (Perspectives in Continental Philosophy)</h2><p><p>Jean Wahl (1888&#x2013;1974), once considered by the likes of Georges Bataille, Gilles Deleuze, Emmanuel Levinas, and Gabriel Marcel to be among the greatest French philosophers, has today nearly been forgotten outside France. Yet his influence on French philosophical thought can hardly be overestimated. Levinas wrote that &#x201c;during over a half century of teaching and research, [Wahl] was the life force of the academic, extra-academic, and even, to a degree anti-academic philosophy necessary to a great culture.&#x201d; And Deleuze, for his part, commented that &#x201c;Apart from Sartre, who remained caught none the less in the trap of the verb to be, the most important philosopher in France was Jean Wahl.&#x201d;</p><p>Besides engaging with the likes of Bataille, Bergson, Deleuze, Derrida, Levinas, Maritain, and Sartre, Wahl also played a significant role, in some cases almost singlehandedly, in introducing French philosophy to movements like existentialism, and American pragmatism and literature, and thinkers like Hegel, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Jaspers, and Heidegger. Yet Wahl was also an original philosopher and poet in his own right. This volume of selections from Wahl&#x2019;s philosophical writings makes a selection of his most important work available to the English-speaking philosophical community for the first time.</p><p>Jean Wahl was Professor of Philosophy at the Sorbonne from 1936 to 1967, save during World War II, which he spent in the United States, having escaped from the Drancy internment camp. His books to appear in English include The Pluralist Philosophies of England and America (Open Court, 1925), The Philosopher's Way (Oxford UP, 1948), A Short History of Existentialism (Philosophical Library, 1949), and Philosophies of Existence (Schocken, 1969).</p></p><p>Jean Wahl was Professor of Philosophy at the Sorbonne from 1936 to 1967, save during World War II, which he spent in the United States, having escaped from the Drancy internment camp.

One of the most interesting and original thinkers of his time, Wahl helped invent existentialism and exerted influence on a host of canonical French philosophers of the twentieth century. Thanks to the marvelous editorial work of Ian Moore and Alan Schrift, this collection of Wahl&#x2019;s writings recovers him for a new generation of readers.&#x201d; (&#x2015;Samuel Moyn <i>Harvard University, author of Origins of the Other: Emmanuel Levinas between Revelation and Ethics</i>)<br><br>Overall, <i>Transcendence and the Concrete</i> makes an important contribution to the study of the life and thought of Jean Wahl and his contemporaries.

In this radical rethinking of Darwinian evolution, Wagner offers a solution to that enduring mystery. He draws on 15 years of research using the latest experimental and computational technologies to uncover the principles of innovability that allow the creation of such complicated adaptations as lactose digestion, camouflage and the antifreeze proteins produced by Arctic cod.</p><p><b>Andreas Wagner</b> is a professor&nbsp;in the Institute of Evolutionary Biology&nbsp;and Environmental Studies at the&nbsp;University of Zurich in Switzerland,&nbsp;and an external professor at the Santa Fe&nbsp;Institute. He lectures worldwide and is&nbsp;a fellow of the American Association&nbsp;for the Advancement of Science. He&nbsp;lives in Zurich, Switzerland.<p></p><p></p><p>PROLOGUE</p><p>World Enough, and Time</p><p>In the spring of 1904, Ernest Rutherford, a thirty-two-year-old New Zealand&#x2013;born physicist then working at McGill University in Canada, gave a lecture at the world&#x2019;s oldest scientific organization, the Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge. His subject was radioactivity and the age of the earth.</p><p>At that time, scientists had long since forsworn the biblical accounts asserting that the earth was only six thousand years old. The most widely accepted dates had been calculated by another physicist&#x2014;William Thomson, better known as Lord Kelvin&#x2014;who had used the equations of thermodynamics and the earth&#x2019;s heat conductivity to estimate that the planet was somewhere around twenty million years old.</p><p>In geology, that&#x2019;s not a lot of time, and the implications were profound. The earth&#x2019;s geological features could not have appeared within this duration if processes like volcanism and erosion proceeded at today&#x2019;s rate.1 But the real victim of Kelvin&#x2019;s estimate was Charles Darwin&#x2019;s theory of evolution by natural selection. Darwin had described himself as &#x201c;greatly troubled at the short duration of the world according to Sir W. Thomson.&#x201d;2 He knew that organisms had not changed much since the last ice ages, and from such little change he inferred that the amount of time needed to create all organisms&#x2014;alive today or preserved in fossils&#x2014;must be truly enormous.3 Twenty million years was not enough time to create life&#x2019;s diversity.</p><p>But Rutherford, who had discovered the phenomenon of radioactive half-life only a few years before, knew that Kelvin was wrong, by at least several orders of magnitude. As he later recalled:</p><p>I came into the room, which was half dark, and presently spotted Lord Kelvin in the audience and realized that I was in for trouble at the last part of the speech dealing with the age of the earth, where my views conflicted with his.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The discovery of the radio-active elements, which in their disintegration liberate enormous amounts of energy, thus increases the possible limit of the duration of life on this planet, and <i>allows</i> <i>the time claimed by the geologist and biologist for the process of evolution.</i>4 (emphasis added).</p><p>And that was that. Kelvin died in 1907. Rutherford won the Nobel Prize in 1908, and by the 1930s his radiometric methods had shown that the earth was around 4.5 billion years old. Darwin&#x2019;s theory was saved, since the processes of random mutation and selection now had the time needed to create life&#x2019;s enormous complexity and diversity.</p><p>Or did they?</p><p>Consider the peregrine falcon,<i> Falco peregrinus,</i> one of nature&#x2019;s great predators and an organism of marvelous perfection. Its powerful musculature, matched with an extremely lightweight skeleton, makes it by far the fastest animal on earth, able to reach more than 200 miles per hour in one of its characteristic dives. All that speed translates into enormous kinetic energy when the falcon strikes its prey in midair with razor-sharp talons. If that impact alone does not deliver death, the falcon can sever the spinal column of its prey with a conveniently notched upper beak.5</p><p>Before moving in for the kill, <i>F. peregrinus </i>needs to track down its prey. The targeting mechanism is a pair of eyes with full-color binocular vision, possessing resolving power more than five times greater than a human&#x2019;s, which means that a peregrine can see a pigeon at distances of more than a mile.6 Like many predators, the falcon has an eye with a nictitating membrane&#x2014;a third eyelid&#x2014;a bit like a windshield wiper that removes dirt while keeping the eye moist during a high-speed chase. The falcon&#x2019;s eyes also harbor more photoreceptors, the rods that capture images in very low light, and the cones that provide color vision. 7 Its photoreceptors render even long-wavelength ultraviolet light visible.</p><p>A marvel indeed. But even more marvelous is knowing that every one of those brilliant adaptations is the sum of innumerable tiny steps, each one preserved by natural selection, each one a change in a single molecule. The deadly beak and talons of <i>F. peregrinus</i> are built from the same raw material as its feathers, the protein molecules known as keratin, the human versions of which make up your hair and nails.8 For color vision, those extraordinary eyes depend on opsins, protein molecules in the eyes&#x2019; rods and cones. Crucial for their remarkable acuity are their lenses, composed of transparent proteins known as crystallins.9</p><p>The first vertebrates to use crystallins in lenses did so more than five hundred million years ago, and the opsins that enable the falcon&#x2019;s vision are some seven hundred million years old.10 They originated some three billion years after life first appeared on earth. That sounds like a helpfully long amount of time to come up with these molecular innovations. But each one of those opsin and crystallin proteins is a chain of hundreds of amino acids, highly specific sequences of molecules written in an alphabet of twenty amino acid letters. If only one such sequence could sense light or help form a transparent cameralike lens, how many different hundred-amino-acid-long protein strings would we have to sift through? The first amino acid of such a string could be any one of the twenty kinds of amino acids, and the same holds for the second amino acid. Because 20 � 20 = 400, there are there are 400 possible strings of two amino acids. Consider also the third amino acid, and you have arrived at 20 � 20 � 20, or 8,000, possibilities. At four amino acids we already have 160,000 possibilities. For a protein with a hundred amino acids (crystallins and opsins are much longer), the numbers multiply to a 1 with more than 130 trailing zeroes, or more than 10130 possible amino acid strings. To get a sense of this number&#x2019;s magnitude, consider that most atoms in the universe are hydrogen atoms, and physicists have estimated the number of these atoms as 1090, or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. This is &#x201c;only&#x201d; a 1 with 90 zeroes. The number of potential proteins is not merely astronomical, it is hyperastronomical, much greater than the number of hydrogen atoms in the universe.11 To find a specific sequence like that is not just less likely than winning the jackpot in the lottery, it is less likely than winning a jackpot every year since the Big Bang.12 In fact, it&#x2019;s countless billions of times less likely. If a trillion different organisms had tried an amino acid string every second since life began, they might have tried a tiny fraction of the 10130 potential ones. They would never have found the one opsin string. There are a lot of different ways to arrange molecules. And not nearly enough time.</p><p>When the seventeenth-century lyric poet Andrew Marvell bemoaned, &#x201c;Had we but world enough, and time&#x201d; to avoid the &#x201c;deserts of vast eternity&#x201d; that lay before him, he was attempting to unlock his mistress&#x2019;s bedchamber, not the secrets of nature. But he was on to something. Common wisdom holds that natural selection, combined with the magic wand of random change, will produce the falcon&#x2019;s eye in good time. This is the mainstream perspective on Darwinian evolution: A tiny fraction of small and random heritable changes confers a reproductive advantage to the organisms that win this genetic lottery and, accumulating over time, such changes explain the falcon&#x2019;s eye&#x2014;and, by extension, everything from the falcon itself to all of life&#x2019;s diversity.</p><p>The power of natural selection is beyond dispute, but this power has limits. Natural selection can <i>preserve</i> innovations, but it cannot <i>create</i> them. And calling the change that creates them random is just another way of admitting our ignorance about it. Nature&#x2019;s many innovations&#x2014;some uncannily perfect&#x2014;call for natural principles that accelerate life&#x2019;s ability to innovate, its <i>innovability</i>.</p><p>For the d last fifteen years, I have been privileged to help uncover these principles, first in the United States and later, joined by a group of highly talented researchers, in my laboratory at the University of Z�rich in Switzerland. Using experimental and computational technologies unimagined by Darwin or Rutherford, our goal is not to discover individual innovations, but to find the wellsprings of <i>all </i>biological innovation. What we have found so far already tells us that there is much more to evolution than meets the eye. It tells us that the principles of innovability are concealed, even beyond the molecular architecture of DNA, in a hidden architecture of life with an otherworldly beauty.</p><p>These principles are the subject of this book.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>What Darwin Didn&#x2019;t Know</p><p>Sallie Gardner was the world&#x2019;s first movie star.

Sallie, you see, happened to be the Thoroughbred horse that the English-born photographer Eadweard Muybridge shot in full gallop with his zoopraxiscope, an array of twenty-four cameras along her path, to settle a pressing question that undoubtedly keeps many people awake at night: Does a galloping horse ever lift all four legs off the ground? (The answer is yes.) His grainy, jerky silent movie, all of a second long, is worlds apart from the high-definition digital surround-sound cinematography taken for granted in the early twenty-first century. Yet the time separating Muybridge&#x2019;s photographic study from modern movies spans just over a century, a stretch not much longer than the time since Darwin published <i>The Origin of Species, </i>only nineteen years before Sallie Gardner&#x2019;s star turn.</p><p>During the same time, biology has been transformed by a revolution even more dramatic than the cinematic one.1 This revolution has revealed a world as inaccessible to Darwin as outer space was to cavemen. And it has helped to answer the single most important question about evolution, the question that Darwin and generations of scientists after him did not, could not touch: How does nature bring forth the new, the better, the superior? How does life create?</p><p>You might be puzzled. Wasn&#x2019;t that exactly Darwin&#x2019;s great achievement, to understand that life evolved and to explain how? Isn&#x2019;t that his legacy? Yes and no. Darwin&#x2019;s theory surely is the most important intellectual achievement of his time, perhaps of all time. But the biggest mystery about evolution eluded his theory. And he couldn&#x2019;t even get close to solving it. To see why, we first need to take a look at what Darwin knew and what he didn&#x2019;t, what was new about his theory and what wasn&#x2019;t, and why only now, more than a century later, can we begin to see how the living world creates.</p><p>Germs of thought about an evolving natural world existed long before Darwin. No fewer than twenty-five hundred years ago, the Greek philosopher Anaximander&#x2014;better known as the great-grandfather of the heliocentric worldview&#x2014;thought that humans emerged from fish. The fourteenth-century Muslim historian Ibn Khaldun thought that life progressed gradually from minerals to plants to animals. Much later, the nineteenth-century French anatomist Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire deduced from fossilized reptiles that they had changed over time.2 The Viennese botanist Franz Unger argued in 1850, just a few years before Darwin published <i>The Origin of Species</i> in 1859, that all other plants descend from algae.3 And the French zoologist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck postulated that evolution occurred through use and disuse of organs. Some of the earliest thinkers even seem prescient about evolution, until you dig a bit and find some bizarre nuggets, such as Anaximander&#x2019;s notion that early humans lived <i>inside</i> fish until puberty, when their hosts burst and released them. Beliefs that are alien to today&#x2019;s science persisted well into Darwin&#x2019;s era. According to one of them, shared by many from the ancient Greeks to Lamarck, simple organisms are spontaneously created from inanimate matter like wet mud.4</p><p>Just as evolution had its proponents, it had equally vocal opponents well into Darwin&#x2019;s era. And no, I do not mean people like today&#x2019;s young earth creationists&#x2014;half literate and wholly ignorant&#x2014;who believe that earth was created on a Saturday night in October of 4004 BC (and that Noah&#x2019;s Ark could have saved more than a million species, but Noah somehow forgot the huge dinosaurs, perhaps forgivably so, considering that he was six hundred years old). I mean scientific leaders of the time. One of them was the French geologist Georges Cuvier, the founder of paleontology, literally the science of &#x201c;ancient beings&#x201d; (think dinosaurs).5 He discovered that the fossils embedded in older rocks are quite different from those in younger rocks, which resemble today&#x2019;s life. Yet he thought that each species had essential, immutable characteristics, and could only vary in superficial traits. Another example is Carl Linnaeus, who lived a mere century before Darwin. He is the father of our modern system for classifying life&#x2019;s diversity, yet until late in life he did not believe in evolution&#x2019;s great chain of living beings.6</p><p>Christian beliefs are the best-known reason for such resistance. To Cuvier, life&#x2019;s diversity wasn&#x2019;t evidence of evolution but of the Creator&#x2019;s great talents. Another reason, however, has even deeper roots. It goes back all the way to the Greek philosopher Plato, whose influence on Western philosophy is so great that the twentieth-century philosopher Alfred North Whitehead demoted all of European philosophy to &#x201c;a series of footnotes to Plato.&#x201d;7 Plato&#x2019;s philosophy was deeply influenced by the ideal, abstract world of mathematics and geometry. It maintains that the visible, material world is but a faint, fleeting shadow of a higher reality, which consists of abstract geometric forms, such as triangles and circles. To a Platonist, basketballs, tennis balls, and Ping-Pong balls share an <i>essence,</i> their ball-like shape. It is this essence&#x2014;perfect, geometric, abstract&#x2014;that is real, not the physical balls, which are as fleeting and changeable as shadows.</p><p>The goals of scientists like Linnaeus and Cuvier&#x2014;to organize the chaos of life&#x2019;s diversity&#x2014;are much easier to achieve if each species has a Platonic essence that distinguishes it from all others, in the same way that the absence of legs and eyelids is essential to snakes and distinguishes them from other reptiles. In this Platonic worldview, the task of naturalists is to find the essence for each species. Actually, that understates the case: In an essentialist world, the essence really <i>is</i> the species.8 Contrast this with an ever-changing evolving world, where species incessantly spew forth new species that can blend with each other.9 The snake <i>Eupodophis</i> from the late Cretaceous period, which had rudimentary hind legs, and the glass lizard, which is alive today and lacks legs, are just two of many witnesses to the blurry boundaries of species. Evolution&#x2019;s messy world is anathema to the clear, pristine order that essentialism craves. It is thus no accident that Plato and his essentialism became the &#x201c;great antihero of evolutionism,&#x201d; as the twentieth-century zoologist Ernst Mayr called it.10</p><p>In the controversy between Darwinists and ...</p></p><h2>The Reformation World (Routledge Worlds)</h2><p><p>This beautifully illustrated book is the most ambitious one-volume survey of the Reformation yet.

Initially developed as a treatment for major depression, IPT has proven highly effective as a therapy for a number of other disorders. IPT can be combined with medication, and it is a safe alternative to medication for those individuals who may not be able to take antidepressants. IPT has been shown not only to relieve symptoms but to build social skills as well.<br><br> Learn how to use IPT to effectively treat depression, as well as other disorders including bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, and borderline personality disorder. Written by the originators of the treatment, this practical book describes how to approach clinical encounters with patients, how to focus IPT treatment, and ways to handle therapeutic difficulties. The book updates research findings on IPT and addresses its adaptation to different cultures. Complete with clinical examples and sample therapist scripts throughout, this guide foregoes the theoretical and empirical background of IPT, and focuses on teaching you the best way to deliver this effective, time-limited, diagnostically focused, and immensely practical treatment.</p><p><br><strong>Myrna M.

And most of the descriptions of the techniques and applications are followed by excellent case examples that really bring the techniques to life."--<em>Psychological Medicine</em><p></p><br>..".a valuable tool for training in IPT...intended as book for busy clinicians who have some exposure to IPT but who lack the time to read more detailed manuals and need a a reference book for practice. This goal is accomplished admirably. [The authors] are also deserving of praise for setting a standard to which other authors should aspire: They have successfully integrated a clinically relevant text with a strong evidence base. This text will be extremely useful for evidence-based social workers practicing in settings that address a range of mental health issues. Furthermore, because it is clear, concise, and applicable to common practice problems it will be a useful text in practice classes."--<em>Research on Social Work Practice</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Malice Aforethought</h2><p><p><i>Malice Aforethought </i>is one of the earliest and finest examples of the inverted detective story &#x2013; we know who committed the crime, the question is, will he get away with it?</p><p>Part of the Macmillan Collector&#x2019;s Library; a series of stunning, clothbound, pocket sized classics with gold foiled edges and ribbon markers.

Born in Watford and educated at Oxford before serving in World War One, he went on to become a journalist for Punch and The Humorist magazines. He wrote his first novel in 1925 and enjoyed success with his many detective novels and short stories. In 1930 he co-founded the famous Detection Club alongside famous crime writers such as Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers. He wrote three novels under the pseudonym Francis Iles of which Malice Aforethought was the most famous.

Silas hoards a treasure that kills his spirit until fate steals it from him and replaces it with a golden-haired founding child. Where she came from, who her parents were, and who really stole the gold are the secrets that permeate this moving tale of guilt and innocence. A moral allegory of the redemptive power of love, it is also a finely drawn picture of early nineteenth-century England in the days when spinning wheels hummed busily in the farmhouses, and of a simple way of life that was soon to disappear.<p></p><p>"I think <i>Silas Marner</i> holds a higher place than any of the author's works.

Why have our political discussions in the United States become so ugly and pointless? Why are we suffering from such a breakdown in civility? In Not Trivial: How Studying the Traditional Liberal Arts Can Set You Free, Laurie Endicott Thomas explains that the problem boils down to education. The word civility originally meant training in the liberal arts. The classical liberal arts were a set of seven disciplines that were developed largely in ancient Athens to promote productive political discussions within Athenian democracy. They included three verbal arts (the trivium): grammar, logic, and rhetoric. They also included four arts of number, space, and time (the quadrivium): mathematics, geometry, music, and astronomy. These arts helped students learn to think rationally and to express themselves persuasively. The ancient Romans called these studies the liberal arts because they were considered appropriate for freeborn men, as opposed to slaves. Slaves were taught only the servile and mechanical arts, to make them more productive as workers. During the Renaissance, the classical liberal arts curriculum was supplemented by the humanities, including history, philosophy, literature, and art. Like the liberal arts, the humanities were intended to promote productive and even pleasant discussions among political decision-makers. Today, the sciences would have to be added to that curriculum. Thomas explains that the problems in our political system start in first grade. Our teachers are being trained and often forced to use a method of reading instruction that does not work. As a result, many children suffer from lifelong problems with reading. Our teachers are also being pressured to neglect the teaching of grammar. As a result, many children end up with poor reading comprehension and lifelong problems with logical thinking. Thus, they will have difficulty in making or appreciating reasonable arguments. Thomas argues that we cannot hope to enjoy freedom and equality until all children get the kind of education that is appropriate for free people. She concludes with a clear explanation of what that curriculum would be like.</p><p>Laurie Endicott Thomas taught herself to read at age four, by studying the rhyming words in Green Eggs and Ham by Dr. Seuss. Thanks to that head start in reading, she was able to get an excellent education in the public schools of Ohio, Wisconsin, and New Jersey. Her classmates who did not figure out the phonics code on their own before they entered school were not so lucky. After receiving a bachelor and master of arts degree in regional science at the University of Pennsylvania, Thomas spent more than 20 years working as an editor and writer in medical and veterinary publishing. She has also copyedited college textbooks on education and philosophy. Although Thomas has never worked in a school, she has essentially taught remedial writing to some of the most highly educated people in the United States: medical doctors. She is also the author of a column on grammar and usage in the American Medical Writers Association Journal. Thomas is aa popular speaker on education and healthcare reform.</p><h2>Coding as a Playground: Programming and Computational Thinking in the Early Childhood Classroom</h2><p><p><em>Coding as a Playground</em> is the first book to focus on how young children (ages 7 and under) can engage in computational thinking and be taught to become computer programmers, a process that can increase both their cognitive and social-emotional skills. Readers will learn how coding can engage children as producers&#x2015;and not merely consumers&#x2015;of technology in a playful way. You will come away from this groundbreaking work with an understanding of how coding promotes developmentally appropriate experiences such as problem solving, imagination, cognitive challenges, social interactions, motor skills development, emotional exploration, and making different choices. You will also learn how to integrate coding into different curricular areas to promote literacy, math, science, engineering, and the arts through a project-based approach.</p></p><p><p><strong>Marina Umaschi Bers</strong> is a professor in the Eliot-Pearson Department of Child Study and Human Development and an adjunct professor in the Computer Science Department at Tufts University.

In <i>The Ancient Phonograph</i>, Shane Butler searches for traces of voices before Edison, reconstructing a series of ancient soundscapes from Aristotle to Augustine. Here the real voices of tragic actors, ambitious orators, and singing emperors blend with the imagined voices of lovesick nymphs, tormented heroes, and angry gods. The resonant world we encounter in ancient sources is at first unfamiliar, populated by texts that speak and sing, often with no clear difference between the two. But Butler discovers a commonality that invites a deeper understanding of why voices mattered then and why they have mattered since. </p><p>With later examples that range from Mozart to Jimi Hendrix, Butler offers an ambitious attempt to rethink the voice&#x2015;as an anatomical presence, a conceptual category, and a source of pleasure and wonder. He carefully and critically assesses the strengths and limits of recent theoretical approaches to the voice by Adriana Cavarero and Mladen Dolar and makes a rich and provocative range of ancient material available for the first time. <i>The Ancient Phonograph </i>will appeal not only to classicists and to voice theorists but to anyone with an interest in the verbal arts&#x2015;literature, oratory, song&#x2015;and the nature of aesthetic experience. </p></p><p>Shane Butler is Professor of Classics at Johns Hopkins University and the author of <i>The Matter of the Page: Essays in Search of Ancient and Medieval Authors</i>.<p><i>The Ancient Phonograph</i> is a resonant book. Resonant because the argument is full-throated and engulfs the reader in symphonic readings of Homer, Greek tragedy, Latin and Greek oratory, Tennyson's poetry, and Mozart's operas. Resonant also because its voice carries far, reaching and drawing from fields that are usually not in conversation with classical studies&#x2015;media studies, sound studies, critical theory, and voice studies. Finally, resonant because its object is both as mesmerizing and as difficult to embrace as a bodiless echo.</p>&#x2015;<i>Classical Philology</i></p><h2>Bathroom Remodeling For Dummies</h2><p>We're a nation of countless bathrooms that are on the brink of being torn apart, redesigned, and remodeled.

It is an excellent simulation and animation tool for milling and turning, which can be used to test existing programs or write and edit new ones. *This book covers the basics of Computer Numerical Control programming, including step-by-step coverage of machining proceses, fundamentals of CNC and basic CNC programming concepts. It can be used as a stand-alone text in a hands-on CNC course or can be used as a supplement in a comprehensive manufacturing process or numerical controls course. The book and software package is an excellent instruction tool for CNC programming.</p><p><p><b>Derek H. Murphy</b> has been with TORCOMP since 1987 and is operations manager of CAD/CAM/CNC/CAE applications. Mr. Murphy graduated from Ryerson Polytechnic University with a Bachelor of Technology degree in Industrial Engineering.</p><b>PREFACE</b><br> Computer numerical control programming skills are important to any engineering student. The CNC Workbook: An Introduction to Computer Numerical Control is an affordable text and software combination designed to introduce students to CNC and provide them with an opportunity to learn and practice at their own pace. The workbook teaches students about CNC programming, and the software, TORCAM CNCez, allows students to create CNC programs and test them in a simulated manufacturing environment. The CNC Workbook may be used as a complete text for a course in computer numerical control, or as an instructional supplement if CNC is a component of another course. Students can even use this package to learn about CNC on their own, outside of the classroom environment. The software will run on high and low end computers, and is ideal for learning, teaching, and testing CNC programming. <br><br> <b>FEATURES OF THE WORKBOOK</b><br> The text introduces students to CNC programming and the use of the TORCAM CNCez simulation software, providing the student with the basics needed to build confidence in CNC programming. <br><br> Chapters 1 through 3 discuss the basic concepts of computer numerical control, including the theoretical and applied aspects. <br><br> Chapter 4 introduces the student to the interface of the TORCAM CNCez simulation software program. <br><br> Chapters 5 and 6 begin teaching the student to program and run simulations. Chapter 5 describes milling, and Chapter 6 covers turning, the two most important and most common uses for CNC programming. Each chapter concludes with five step-by-step tutorials to help the student develop programming skills. <br><br> Chapter 7 describes the basics of Computer Aided Design and Computer Aided Manufacturing. <br><br> Chapter 8 provides extra exercises for the student, including questions to answer and new simulations to program. <br><br> <b>FEATURES OF THE SOFTWARE</b><br> One of the biggest problems in learning CNC technology and specifically CNC programming is finding time for the hands-on training required on a CNC machine tool. The CNC Workbook lessens the student's dependence on traditional classroom-style learning and maximizes the amount of hands-on CNC programming time available to each student or trainee. Using the software allows the student to perform dry rounds of all CNC programs in a simulated manufacturing environment. By using TORCAM CNCez to test a program, the student needs to use a CNC machine tool only for final confirmation of a design. <br><br> Two other key features of this learning system are safety and comfort. Since this software will emulate a CNC milling machine or CNC lathe, the student can do all the necessary CNC programming training and later write, edit, and test new CNC programs on the computer. Since a CNC machine is not actually being used, both the student and the instructor can learn in a safer and more comfortable environment. <br><br> One special feature of TORCAM CNCez is that the on-screen simulator and the programming editor are interactive. As the user creates and edits CNC programs, the screen graphics immediately show the result of each new step, providing instant feedback. Students will know immediately which part of their program generated which result. <br><br> For users with prior knowledge and experience with CNC programming, the TORCAM CNCez simulation software can be used to test existing CNC programs which follow the EIA/ISO standards, and to write and edit new ones. The workbook may be used as a reference guide, or the user may select the HELP menu option on the screen for assistance. <br><br> <b>A WARNING TO THE READY</b><br> The objective of this workbook and software combination is to teach CNC programming. It is NOT to instruct the user on machining terms or procedures, nor does skill in the use of the simulation software mean that actual hands-on experience with manufacturing equipment can be eliminated. All speeds and feeds used in this manual have been tested on machinable wax only, and are not recommended for any harder materials or metals. <br><br> All programs in this manual have been tested for reliability. Some changes may be required to adopt these programs to non-TORCAM CNC machines.

It surveys North African earthen buildings, Hispanic-influenced Native American pueblos and churches of the American Southwest, and the contemporary architecture of Santa Fe and Taos, showcasing interiors, exteriors, and special features in gorgeous color photos (by Michael Freeman). The text is clear and informative. Of interest to a wide audience of architects, interior designers, and those with an interest in the esthetic, ecological, and economic appeal of adobe. No index. Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.</p><p>Larkin is the editor-designer of the best-selling Barn and Shaker and the author of Farm, among many other books published here and abroad. He currently lives in Cherry Plain, New York.When David Larkin's name graces a title page, the book is bound to be well designed and full of superb color photographs. His most recent projects include <i>Frank Lloyd Wright: The Masterworks</i> and <i>Barn</i> (1993). Here Larkin has teamed up with Romero, library director for the Palace of the Governors in Santa Fe and expert on adobe in particular and southwestern culture in general, to create a picture-rich study of the history, technology, and dignified, sculptural beauty of adobe structures. The oldest of building materials, adobe bricks are made from mud and straw and have been used in Africa, the Iberian peninsula, and all across the Southwest and Mexico. Surprisingly durable if maintained, adobe constructions can last for centuries. Romero and Larkin explain brick-making and remudding techniques, showing both archival photographs of Native Americans at work on their pueblos and photographs of contemporary builders. They also document some of the Southwest's most famous adobe churches and pueblos, such as the San Francisco Mission Church at Ranchos de Taos and the wondrous mesa-crowning Acoma Pueblo, as well as a selection of lesser-known buildings. Special attention is paid to interior decorative detail and to adobe's intrinsic connection to the landscape. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>The Work of Mourning</h2><p>Jacques Derrida is, in the words of the<i> New York Times</i>, "perhaps the world's most famous philosopher&#x2014;if not the only famous philosopher." He often provokes controversy as soon as his name is mentioned. But he also inspires the respect that comes from an illustrious career, and, among many who were his colleagues and peers, he inspired friendship. <i>The Work of Mourning</i> is a collection that honors those friendships in the wake of passing.<br><br>Gathered here are texts&#x2014;letters of condolence, memorial essays, eulogies, funeral orations&#x2014;written after the deaths of well-known figures: Roland Barthes, Paul de Man, Michel Foucault, Louis Althusser, Edmond Jab�s, Louis Marin, Sarah Kofman, Gilles Deleuze, Emmanuel Levinas, Jean-Fran�ois Lyotard, Max Loreau, Jean-Marie Benoist, Joseph Riddel, and Michel Servi�re.<br><br>With his words, Derrida bears witness to the singularity of a friendship and to the absolute uniqueness of each relationship. In each case, he is acutely aware of the questions of tact, taste, and ethical responsibility involved in speaking of the dead&#x2014;the risks of using the occasion for one's own purposes, political calculation, personal vendetta, and the expiation of guilt. More than a collection of memorial addresses, this volume sheds light not only on Derrida's relation to some of the most prominent French thinkers of the past quarter century but also on some of the most important themes of Derrida's entire oeuvre-mourning, the "gift of death," time, memory, and friendship itself.<br><br>"In his rapt attention to his subjects' work and their influence upon him, the book also offers a hesitant and tangential retelling of Derrida's own life in French philosophical history. There are illuminating and playful anecdotes&#x2014;how Lyotard led Derrida to begin using a word-processor; how Paul de Man talked knowledgeably of jazz with Derrida's son. Anyone who still thinks that Derrida is a facetious punster will find such resentful prejudice unable to survive a reading of this beautiful work."&#x2014;Steven Poole, <i>Guardian</i><br><br>"Strikingly <i>simpa</i> meditations on friendship, on shared vocations and avocations and on philosophy and history."&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly </i></p><p><b>Jacques Derrida</b> is the director of studies at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, Paris, and professor of humanities at the University of California, Irvine. He is the author of many books including <i>The Gift of Death</i> and <i>Archive Fever</i>, both published by the University of Chicago Press. <b>Pascale-Anne Brault</b> is an associate professor of French at DePaul University. <b>Michael Naas</b> is a professor of philosophy at DePaul University. Together they have translated several works by Derrida, including <i>Memoirs of the Blind</i>, published by the University of Chicago Press, and <i>Adieu</i>.Over the last decade, Derrida (Of Grammatology), the doyen of deconstruction, has turned his attention to questions of ethics and politics. While the obtuse philosophical musings and sometimes torturous prose of his earlier books often frustrated readers, his more recent books (e.g., The Politics of Friendship) offer glimpses of Derrida's struggles to grapple honestly with the traces and aphorias of being that mark his more theoretical work. In this collection of funeral orations, letters of condolence, memorial essays, and eulogies, some published for the first time in English, Derrida celebrates close friends even as he grieves over their loss. The act of mourning, he says, begins as soon as friendship begins, for "one of the two of you will inevitably see the other one die." But the work of mourning is also a memorial act, for the other is alive in us, even after death. Characteristically, Derrida demonstrates the inextricable bond between name and memory; hearers remember a person when we speak his or her name, and thus we keep our friends alive. Some of these 14 pieces are marked by turgid prose, but others poignantly wrestle with life's ultimate mystery. Even so, this book will be most appropriate for academic libraries and large public libraries where Derrida is popular. Henry L.

Among peoples of Asia Minor, where her cult first began, she often shared the names of local mountains. The Greeks commonly called her Cybele, the name given to her by the Phrygians of Asia Minor, and identified her with their own mother goddesses Rhea, Gaia, and Demeter. The Romans adopted her worship at the end of the Second Punic War and called her Mater Magna, Great Mother. Her cult became one of the three most important mystery cults in the Roman Empire, along with those of Mithras and Isis. And as Christianity took hold in the Roman world, ritual elements of her cult were incorporated into the burgeoning cult of the Virgin Mary.</p><p>In <i>Mother of the Gods</i>, Philippe Borgeaud traces the journey of this divine figure through Asia Minor, Greece, and Rome between the sixth century B.C. and the fourth century A.D. He examines how the Mother of the Gods was integrated into specific cultures, what she represented to those who worshiped her, and how she was used as a symbol in art, myth, and even politics. The Mother of the Gods was often seen as a dualistic figure: ancestral and foreign, aristocratic and disreputable, nurturing and dangerous. Borgeaud's challenging and nuanced portrait opens new windows on the ancient world's sophisticated religious beliefs and shifting cultural identities.</p></p><p><p><b>Philippe Borgeaud </b> is a professor of the history of religion at the University of Geneva and the author of several books, including <i>The Cult of Pan in Ancient Greece</i>.</p><p>"Borgeaud has read widely and chooses judiciously from among an array of pictorial and written remains to construct a series of striking images that reveal and unravel the amazingly complex paths taken by the goddess and her companions during a millennium of antiquity."</p> (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br><p>"This slim book is packed with terrific material... Flashes of insight are something Borgeaud does well. He also asks big questions."</p> (<i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br><p>"A carefully researched and... persuasively argued book that will be of interest to academic libraries and scholars in the field."</p> (Joseph Molleur <i>Anglican Theological Review</i>)<br><br><p>"<i>Mother of the Gods</i> reaches out far beyond its ostensible subject&#x2015;the cult of the divine mother in Greece, Rome, and Christianity. It is rich with implications for our understanding of antiquity in general&#x2015;and, for that matter, for our understanding of culture and society. Philippe Borgeaud provides a model of scholarship: concise, clear, consistently interesting and lively, at moments quite deep. This is a book that every scholar interested in ancient religion will have to read."</p> (James Redfield, University of Chicago)<br><br><p>"Fascinating narrative... combined with the visually-striking jacket cover illustration... entices the potential reader."</p> (Daniel Keating <i>Henoch</i>)</p><h2>The Poetry of Sappho</h2><p>Today, thousands of years after her birth, in lands remote from her native island of Lesbos and in languages that did not exist when she wrote her poetry in Aeolic Greek, Sappho remains an important name among lovers of poetry and poets alike,. Celebrated throughout antiquity as the supreme Greek poet of love and of the personal lyric, noted especially for her limpid fusion of formal poise, lucid insight, and incandescent passion, today her poetry is also prized for its uniquely vivid participation in a living paganism. Collected in an edition of nine scrolls by scholars in the second century B.C., Sappho&#39;s poetry largely disappeared when the Fourth Crusade sacked Constantinople in 1204. All that remained was one poem and a handful of quoted passages. A century ago papyrus fragments recovered in Egypt added a half dozen important texts to Sappho&#39;s surviving works. In 2004 a new complete poem was deciphered and published. By far the most significant discovery in a hundred years, it offers a new and tellingly different example of Sappho&#39;s poetic art and reveals another side of the poet, thinking about aging and about the transmission of culture from one generation to the next. Jim Powell&#39;s translations represent a unique combination of poetic mastery in English verse and a deep schlolarly engagement with Sappho&#39;s ancient Greek. They are incomparably faithful to the literal sense of the Greek poems and, simultaneously, to their forms, preserving the original meters and stanzas while exactly replicating the dramatic action of their sequences of disclosure and the passionate momentum of their sentences. Powell&#39;s translations have often been anthologized and selected for use in textbooks, winning recognition among discerning readers as by far the best versions in English.</p><p><br>A MacArthur Fellow who has taught at Reed College, the University of Chicago, and the University of California, Berkeley,<strong> Jim Powell</strong> is the author of two poetry collections, <em>It Was Fever that Made the World </em>and<em> Substrate</em>.<br></p><h2>The Certified Manager of Quality/Organizational Excellence Handbook, Fourth Edition</h2><p>This handbook is a comprehensive reference source designed to help professionals address organizational issues from the application of the basic principles of management to the development of strategies needed to deal with the technological and societal concerns of the new millennium. The content of this fourth edition has been revised to reflect a more current global perspective and to match the updated Body of Knowledge (BoK) of ASQ&#39;s Certified Manager of Quality/Organizational Excellence (CMQ/OE). In order to provide a broad perspective of quality management, this book has specifically been written to address: Historical perspectives relating to the evolution of particular aspects of quality management, including recognized experts and their contributions; Key principles, concepts, and terminology relevant in providing quality leadership, and communicating quality needs and results; Benefits associated with the application of key concepts and quality management principles; Best practices describing recognized approaches for good quality management; Barriers to success, including common problems that the quality manager might experience when designing and implementing quality management, and insights as to why some quality initiatives fail; Guidance for preparation to take the CMQ/OE examination. Organized to follow the BoK exactly, throughout each section of this handbook the categorical BoK requirements associated with good quality management practices for that section are shown in a box preceding the pertinent text. These BoK requirements represent the range of content and the cognitive level to which multiple-choice questions can be presented. Although this handbook thoroughly prepares individuals for the ASQ CMQ/OE exam, the real value resides in post-exam usage as a day-to-day reference source for assessing quality applications and methodologies in daily processes. The content is written from the perspective of practitioners, and its relevance extends beyond traditional product quality applications.</p><p></p><h2>The Semantic Tradition from Kant to Carnap: To the Vienna Station</h2><p>This major publication is a history of the semantic tradition in philosophy from the early nineteenth century through its incarnation in the work of the Vienna Circle, the group of logical positivists that emerged in the years 1925-1935 in Vienna who were characterised by a strong commitment to empiricism, a high regard for science, and a conviction that modern logic is the primary tool of analytic philosophy. In the first part of the book, Alberto Coffa traces the roots of logical positivism in a semantic tradition that arose in opposition to Kant&#39;s theory that a priori knowledge is based on pure intuition and the constitutive powers of the mind. In Part II, Coffa chronicles the development of this tradition by members and associates of the Vienna Circle. Much of Coffa&#39;s analysis draws on the unpublished notes and correspondence of many philosophers. The book, however, is not merely a history of the semantic tradition from Kant &#39;to the Vienna Station&#39;. Coffa also critically reassesses the role of semantic notions in understanding the ground of a priori knowledge and its relation to empirical knowledge and questions the turn the tradition has taken since Vienna.</p><p>This major publication is a history of the semantic tradition in philosophy from the early nineteenth century through its incarnation in the work of the Vienna Circle of logical positivists. J. Albert Coffa traces the roots of logical positivism in a semantic tradition that arose in opposition to Kant&#39;s theory that a priori knowledge is based on pure intuition and the constitutive powers of the mind, and chronicles the development of this tradition by members and associates of the Vienna Circle."This is an important book. It sets a standard for discussions of early analytic philosophy, sets the problems for the emerging subject of the history of Positivism and it makes a strong claim for the place of the 'semantic' tradition as an equal to Kantianism and Positivism in 19th-century philosophy and as the direct ancestory of Analytic philosophy. Coffa demonstrates the richness of the views of the Vienna Circle, and a continuity with earlier neo-Kantian philosophy, that should put to rest the caricature of Positivists as attacking a tradition they did not understand. This is all done with carefully crafted and argued discussions of the relevant philosophers, and presented with a lively, if searing, wit."

Clearly, Tannen's insights into how and why women and men so often misunderstand each other when they talk has touched a nerve. For years a highly respected scholar in the field of linguistics, she has now become widely known for her work on how conversational style differences associated with gender affect relationships. Her life work has demonstrated how close and intelligent analysis of conversation can reveal the extraordinary complexities of social relationships--including relationships between men and women. <br> Now, in <em>Gender and Discourse</em>, Tannen has gathered together six of her scholarly essays, including her newest and previously unpublished work in which language and gender are examined through the lens of "sex-class-linked" patterns, rather than "sex-linked" patterns. These essays provide a theoretical backdrop to her best-selling books--and an informative introduction which discusses her field of linguistics, describes the research methods she typically uses, and addresses the controversies surrounding her field as well as some misunderstandings of her work. (She argues, for instance, that her cultural approach to gender differences does not deny that men dominate women in society, nor does it ascribe gender differences to women's "essential nature.") The essays themselves cover a wide range of topics. In one, she analyzes a number of conversational strategies--such as interruption, topic raising, indirection, and silence--and shows that, contrary to much work on language and gender, no strategy exclusively expresses dominance or submissiveness in conversation--interruption (or overlap) can be supportive, silence and indirection can be used to control. It is the interactional context, the participants' individual styles, and the interaction of their styles, Tannen shows, that result in the balance of power. She also provides a fascinating analysis of four groups of males and females (second-, sixth-, and tenth-grade students, and twenty-five year olds) conversing with their best friends, and she includes an early article co-authored with Robin Lakoff that presents a theory of conversational strategy, illustrated by analysis of dialogue in Ingmar Bergman's <em>Scenes from a Marriage</em>. <br> Readers interested in the theoretical framework behind Tannen's work will find this volume fascinating. It will be sure to interest anyone curious about the crucial yet often unnoticed role that language and gender play in our daily lives.<br></p><p>Deborah Tannen&#39;s You Just Don&#39;t Understand has been on the New York Times Best Seller list for nearly four years.

The resulting book&#x2014;which sheds new light on each of Herman&#x2019;s musicals and their scores&#x2014;abounds in fascinating anecdotes and behind-the-scenes details about the world of musical theater. Readers will find a sharply drawn portrait of Herman&#x2019;s private life and his creative talents. Citron&#x2019;s insights into Herman&#x2019;s music and lyrics, including voluminous examples from each of his musicals, are as instructive as they are edifying and entertaining.</p></p><p><p><b>Stephen Citron</b> is well known for shedding fresh light on the American musical theater and the artists who inhabit it. His previous books include <i>Songwriting, The Musical from the Inside Out, </i>and biographies of No�l Coward, Cole Porter, Alan Jay Lerner, Oscar Hammerstein 2nd, Stephen Sondheim, and Andrew Lloyd Webber.</p>Citron (The Musical from the Inside Out), the biographer of Broadway greats Stephen Sondheim and Andrew Lloyd Webber, offers up a comprehensive overview of composer Jerry Herman&#x2019;s works and a rose-tinted look at the man behind the music. Drawing on extensive interviews with Herman, Citron relays the arc of his life and career, from the ballad he wrote at the age of 13 (called "It&#x2019;s Not My Fault") to his critically acclaimed first musical, Milk and Honey (1961), to the smashing success of Hello Dolly! (1963). Citron obviously admires Herman and his oeuvre; in his acknowledgements, he writes "Herman is that rare subject, a joy for a biographer, possessed of total recall and never too busy to answer a question. Honest but never hurtful in discussing colleagues, giving but not controlling." This effusive praise extends to Herman&#x2019;s musicals: Mame is "foolproof" and "one of the finest musicals of the sixties," while a ballad from Mack and Mabel is "in the top echelon of dramatic art." And as for Herman&#x2019;s critics, Citron simply dismisses their claims. The result is a one-sided portrait of an unrelentingly nice guy. When Citron isn&#x2019;t lauding his subject, however, he does offer some knowledgeable insights into the musical qualities of Herman&#x2019;s shows.

In this book Dr. Scuka presents an up-to-date, comprehensive theoretical and practical treatment of RE, in which he gives the reader a guide to implementing the principles of this dynamic theory. The book is written principally with couples therapy in mind, although there is an acknowledged relevance to family therapy, and the author calls attention the many skills and therapy techniques that would be applicable to family therapy. Though designed to allow a therapist of any level of experience to begin working with the RE model, this book is more than a standard cookbook, as it considers a variety of special RE therapy techniques, discusses the entire clinical intake process, the application of the RE model to the treatment of affairs, use with difficult clients, and family therapy issues such as domestic violence and stepfamilies.</p><p><strong>Rob Scuka, Ph.D., M.S.W., is Executive Director of the</strong> <strong>National Institute of Relationship Enhancement (NIRE),</strong> <strong>and has served as an Adjunct Faculty Member at the School</strong> <strong>of Social Work, University of Maryland at Baltimore. <br></strong><em>"Scuka successfully provides a platform for understanding each member of the couple unit and how they can work towards shared goals and improved dialogue...all relational therapists would benefit from reading this book. Not only does Scuka thoroughly cover each step with care, but he allows the reader to understand his ideas via examples that create a colorful palate of information and allow the reader to visualize his ideas." </em><strong>- Brent Fladmo, <em>Journal of Couple and Relationship Therapy</em></strong></p><h2>Altarpiece in Renaissance Italy</h2><p>The most magnificent works of art of the Italian Renaissance were religious altarpieces. Intended as rich and beautiful creations, they were also the product of the most important developments in painting. Jacob Burckhardt is best known as the author of &#34;The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy&#34;. His lucid approach to the themes of painting characterize all his writings on the Renaissance. His essays on the altarpieces, written in 1898, remain an excellent introduction to the subject. This edition is the first time the work has been published both in English and as an illustrated book. Peter Humfrey is the author of &#34;Cima da Conegliano&#34; and many articles on Italian Renaissance painting.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: GermanThe first English translation, abundantly illustrated with over 200 color and black-and-white reproductions, of Burckhardt's "Das Altarbild." This 1894 essay by the seminal historian takes a thematic--rather than chronological--approach to the painted and sculptural altarpiece in Italy from the 14th through the mid-16th centuries. While research since Burckhardt (1818-1897) makes this work primarily of interest to historians of art, the essay is surprisingly fresh in Humfrey's translation. Humfrey has also judiciously divided the text with subheadings and has added notes and index. Recommended for research collections.<br><i>- Annette Melville, Research Lib.

It involves reintroducing missing plants and animals, rebuilding soils, eliminating hazardous substances, ripping up roads, and returning natural processes such as fire and flooding to places that thrive on their regular occurrence. Thousands of restoration projects take place in North America every year. In <i>Nature by Design</i>, Eric Higgs argues that profound philosophical and cultural shifts accompany these projects. He explores the ethical and philosophical bases of restoration and the question of what constitutes good ecological restoration.</p><p>Higgs explains how and why the restoration movement came about, where it fits into the array of approaches to human relationships with the land, and how it might be used to secure a sustainable future. Some environmental philosophers and activists worry that restoration will dilute preservation and conservation efforts and lead to an even deeper technological attitude toward nature. They ask whether even well-conceived restoration projects are in fact just expressions of human will. Higgs prefaces his responses to such concerns by distinguishing among several types of ecological restoration. He also describes a growing gulf between professionals and amateurs. Higgs finds much merit in criticism about technological restoration projects, which can cause more damage than they undo. These projects often ignore the fact that changing one thing in a complex system can change the whole system. For restoration projects to be successful, Higgs argues, people at the community level must be engaged. These focal restorations bring communities together, helping volunteers develop a dedication to place and encouraging democracy.</p></p><p>Eric Higgs is Director of the School of Environmental Studies at the University of Victoria, Canada. He is Chair of the Board of Directors of the Society for Ecological Restoration.<p><i>Nature by Design</i> is a figurative compass indicating a direction that leads towards altered, healing relations between humankind and the larger, older, and increasingly fragile natural world. As Higgs notes, to dare set out on that course is as much a calling as a profession.</p>&#x2015;<b>Max Oelschlaeger</b>, F.B.

Sarah van Gelder and her colleagues at <i>YES! Magazine</i> have been exploring the meaning of real happiness for eighteen years. Here they offer fascinating research, in-depth essays, and compelling personal stories by visionaries such as Annie Leonard, Matthieu Ricard, and Vandana Shiva, showing us that real well-being is found in supportive relationships and thriving communities, opportunities to make a contribution, and the renewal we receive from a thriving natural world. In the pages of this book, you&#x2019;ll find creative and practical ways to cultivate a happiness that is nurturing, enduring, and life affirming.</p><p>Sarah van Gelder is the cofounder and editor-in-chief of YES! Magazine and YesMagazine.org, a national, nonprofit media organization that reframes the biggest problems of our time in terms of their solutions.INTRODUCTION:<br> HOW OCCUPY WALL STREET<br> CHANGES EVERYTHING<br><br> SARAH VAN GELDER<br><br> &#x201c;We fail to understand why we should have to pay the costs of the crisis, while its instigators continue to post record profits. We&#x2019;re sick and tired of one injustice after another. We want human dignity back again.<br><br> This isn&#x2019;t the kind of world we want to live in, and it&#x2019;s we who have to decide what world we do want. We know we can change it, and we&#x2019;re having a great time going about it.&#x201d;<br><br> From #HowToCamp by the Spanish indignados, whose occupations in cities throughout Spain helped inspire Occupy Wall Street<br><br> Something happened in September 2011 so unexpected that no politician or pundit saw it coming.<br><br> Inspired by the Arab Spring and uprisings in Europe, sparked by a challenge from Adbusters magazine to show up at Wall Street on September 17 and &#x201c;bring a tent,&#x201d; and encouraged by veteran New York activists, a few thousand people gathered in the financial district of New York City. At the end of the day, some of them set up camp in Zuccotti Park and started what became a national&#x2014;and now international&#x2014;movement.<br><br> The Occupy movement, as it has come to be called, named the source of the crises of our time: Wall Street banks, big corporations, and others among the 1% are claiming the world&#x2019;s wealth for themselves at the expense of the 99% and having their way with our governments. This is a truth that political insiders and the media had avoided, even while the assets of the top 1% reached levels not seen since the 1920s. But now that this genie is out of the bottle, it can&#x2019;t easily be put back in.<br><br> Without offices, paid staff, or a bank account, Occupy Wall Street quickly spread beyond New York. People gathered in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Portland, Atlanta, San Diego, and hundreds of other cities around the United States and claimed the right of we the people to create a world that works for the 99%. In a matter of weeks, the occupations and protests had spread worldwide, to over 1,500 cities, from Madrid to Cape Town and from Buenos Aires to Hong Kong, involving hundreds of thousands of people.<br><br> The Occupy Wall Street movement is not just demanding change. It is also transforming how we, the 99%, see ourselves. The shame many of us felt when we couldn&#x2019;t find a job, pay down our debts, or keep our home is being replaced by a political awakening. Millions now recognize that we are not to blame for a weak economy, for a subprime mortgage meltdown, or for a tax system that favors the wealthy but bankrupts the government. The 99% are coming to see that we are collateral damage in an all-out effort by the super-rich to get even richer.<br><br> Now that we see the issue clearly&#x2014;and now that we see how many others are in the same boat&#x2014;we can envision a new role for ourselves. We will no longer be isolated and powerless. We can hold vigils all night when necessary and nonviolently face down police. We are the vast majority of the population and, once we get active, we cannot be ignored. Our leaders will not fix things for us; we&#x2019;ll have to do that ourselves. We&#x2019;ll have to make the decisions, too. And we&#x2019;ll have to take care of one another&#x2014;provide the food, shelter, protection, and support needed to make it through long occupations, bad weather, and the hard work of finding consensus when we disagree.<br><br> By naming the issue, the movement has changed the political discourse. No longer can the interests of the 99% be ignored. The movement has unleashed the political power of millions and issued an open invitation to everyone to be part of creating a new world.<br><br> Historians may look back at September 2011 as the time when the 99% awoke, named our crisis, and faced the reality that none of our leaders are going to solve it. This is the moment when we realized we would have to act for ourselves.<br><br> The Truth is Out: The System is Rigged in Favor of the Wealthy<br><br> One of the signs at the Occupy Seattle protest reads: &#x201c;Dear 1%. We were asleep. Now we&#x2019;ve woken up. Signed, the 99%.&#x201d;<br><br> This sign captures the feeling of many in the Occupy movement. We are seeing our ways of life, our aspirations, and our security slip away&#x2014;not because we have been lazy or undisciplined, or lacked intelligence and motivation, but because the wealthiest among us have rigged the system to enhance their own power and wealth at the expense of everyone else.<br><br> Critics of the movement say they oppose the redistribution of wealth on principle. But redistribution is exactly what has been happening for decades. Today&#x2019;s economy redistributes wealth from the poor and middle class to those at the top. The income of the top 1% grew 275 percent between 1979 and 2007, according to the Congressional Budget Office. For those in the bottom 20 percent, income grew just 18 percent during those twenty-eight years.<br><br> The government actively facilitates this concentration of wealth through tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy, and bailouts for giant banks and corporations. These entities also benefit from mining rights, logging rights, airwave rights, and countless other licenses to use common assets for private profit. Corporations shift the costs of environmental damage to the public and pocket the profits. Taxpayers bear the risk of global financial speculation while the payoffs go to those most effective at gaming the system. Instead of investing profits to provide jobs and produce needed goods and services, the 1% put their wealth into mergers, acquisitions, and more speculation.<br><br> The list of government interventions on behalf of the 1% goes on and on: Tax breaks favor the wealthy, global trade agreements encourage offshoring jobs, agricultural subsidies favor agribusiness over family farms, corporate media get sanctioned monopolies while independent media gets squeezed.<br><br> The people who go to work producing things we need&#x2014;the middle class and working poor&#x2014;pay the price for all this. Speculative profits act as a drain on the economy&#x2014;like a hidden tax. This hidden tax is one of the many reasons the middle-class standard of living has been slipping.<br><br> This lopsided division of wealth corrupts government. Few among the 99% now believe government works for their benefit&#x2014;and for good reason. With the 1% commanding an army of lobbyists and doling out money from multimillion-dollar campaign war chests, government has become a source of protection and subsidies for Wall Street. No wonder there isn&#x2019;t enough money left over for education, repairing roads and bridges, taking care of veterans and retirees, much less for the critical transition we need to make to a clean energy future.<br><br> The system is broken in so many ways that it&#x2019;s dizzying to try to name them all. This is part of the reason why the Occupy movement hasn&#x2019;t created a list of demands. The problem is everywhere and looks different from every point of view. The one thing the protesters all seem to agree on is that the middle-class way of life is moving out of reach. Talk to people at any of the Occupy sites and you&#x2019;ll hear stories of people who play by the rules, work long hours, study hard, and then find only low-wage jobs, often without health care coverage or prospects for a secure future.<br><br> And many can find no job at all. In the United States, twenty-five million people are unemployed, underemployed or have given up looking for work. Forty-five percent of those without jobs have been unemployed for more than twenty-seven weeks. Some employers won&#x2019;t hire anyone who is currently unemployed. Meanwhile, the cost of health care, education, rent, food, and energy continues to rise; the only thing that&#x2019;s falling is the value of homes and retirement funds.<br><br> Behind these statistics are real people. Since the Occupy movement began, some who identify themselves as part of the 99% have been posting their stories at wearethe99percent.tumblr.com. Here&#x2019;s one: &#x201c;I am a lucky one. I have enough money to eat three of four weeks of the month. I have been paying student loans for fifteen years and still no dent. My husband lost his job...Last year I took a 10 percent pay cut to &#x2018;do my share&#x2019; and keep layoffs at bay. I lost my house. I went bankrupt. I still am paying over one thousand dollars in student loans for myself and my husband and that is just interest. We will not have children. How could we when we can&#x2019;t even feed ourselves? I am the 99%.&#x201d;<br><br> Another personal story, by a sixty-year-old, reads, &#x201c;Got laid off. Moved two thousand miles for new job. Pays 40 percent less than old job. Sold home at a loss. Filed Chapter Eleven. Owe IRS fifty thousand dollars. Fifteen thousand dollar per year debt for son&#x2019;s tuition at state university. Seventy-five percent of retirement funds shifted to the 1%! I am the 99%!&#x201d;<br><br> The Web site contains thousands of stories like these.<br><br> Now that we know we are not alone, we are less likely to blame ourselves when things are hard. And now that we are seeing the ways the system is rigged against us, we can join with others to demand changes that will allow everyone to thrive.<br><br> We the People Now Know That We Have the Right, and the Power<br><br> The power of the Occupy Wall Street movement is rippling out far beyond the people camped at Zuccotti Park in lower Manhattan, and even beyond the occupation sites springing up in cities around the world. This movement is reaching people who are carrying a protest sign for the first time, including some conservatives, along with union members who have been fighting a losing battle to maintain their standard of living.<br><br> Hundreds of thousands have participated in the protests and occupations, millions support the occupations, and tens of millions more support their key issues. Polls show that jobs continues to be the issue that most concerns us, yet the national dialogue has been dominated by obsession with debt. While just 27 percent of Americans responding to an October 2011 Time Magazine poll held a favorable view of the Tea Party, for example, 54 percent held a favorable view of the Occupy Wall Street movement. Of those familiar with the protests, large majorities share their concerns: 86 percent agreed that Wall Street and lobbyists have too much power in Washington, DC, 68 percent thought the rich should pay more taxes, and 79 percent believe the gap between rich and poor has grown too large.<br><br> The movement has been criticized for its diversity of people and grievances, but in that diversity lies its strength. Among the 99% are recent graduates and veterans who can&#x2019;t find work, elderly who fear losing their pensions, the long-term unemployed, the homeless, peace activists, people with a day job in a corporate office who show up after work, members of the military, and off-duty police. Those involved cannot be pigeonholed. They are as diverse as the people of this country and this world.<br><br> The movement has also been criticized for its failure to issue a list of demands. In fact, it is easy to see what the movement is demanding: quite simply, a world that works for the 99%. The hand-lettered protest signs show the range of concerns: excessive student debt; banks that took taxpayer bailouts, then refused to help homeowners stay in their homes; cuts in government funding for essential services; Federal Reserve policies; the lack of jobs.<br><br> A list of specific demands would make it easier to manage, criticize, co-opt, and divide the movement. Instead, Occupy Wall Street is setting its own agenda on its own terms and developing consensus statements at its own pace. It&#x2019;s doing this in spaces that it controls&#x2014;some in parks and other public spaces, others in union halls, libraries, churches, and community centers. On the Internet, the movement issues statements and calls to action through Twitter, Facebook, and its own Web sites. From the start it was clear that the movement would not rely on a mainstream media corrupted by corporate interests.<br><br> The Occupy Wall Street movement does not treat power as something to request&#x2014;something that others can either grant or withhold. We the people are the sovereigns under the Constitution. The Occupy Wall Street movement has become a space where a multitude of leaders are learning to work together, think independently, and define the world we want to live in.<br><br> Those leaders will be stirring things up for years to come.<br><br> This Is What Horizontal Power Looks Like<br><br> When political parties talk about building a base, they usually mean developing foot soldiers who will help candidates win election and then go home to let the elected officials make the decisions. The Occupy Wall Street movement turns that idea on its head. The ordinary people who have chosen to be part of this movement are the ones who debate the issues, determine strategies, and lead the work.<br><br> Working groups take care of practical matters like food, sanitation, media, meeting facilitation, and receiving packages from supporters. Other groups discuss the issues, create arts and culture, debate tactics, and consider whether to issue demands. In Zuccotti Park, the Consciousness Working Group set up a permanent sacred space for prayer and meditation; spiritual leaders from various faiths show up to lead observances. The early weeks of the occupation coincided with Yom Kippur, and a thousand Jewish activists participated in services across from Zuccotti Park. They erected in the park a sukkah, a temporary hut built to represent the impromptu housing Israelites used in the desert when escaping Egypt. Because the building of structures at Zuccotti Park is forbidden, this was an act of civil disobedience.<br><br> At the center of this movement are general assemblies, where decisions are made by consensus. Facilitators are charged with managing the process so that all have a chance to be heard and everyone has a chance to express approval, disapproval, or to block consensus by means of hand signals.<br><br> The use of the people&#x2019;s microphone is a central feature of the general assemblies. To use the people&#x2019;s mic, a person first grabs the attention of the crowd by shouting, &#x201c;Mic check!&#x201d; Then, he or she begins to speak, saying a few words at a time, so that others can shout the words on to those behind them in the crowd.<br><br> Originally developed as a way to circumvent bans on amplification at many occupation sites, the people&#x2019;s mic has developed into much more than that. It encourages deeper listening because audience members must actively repeat the language of the speaker. It encourages consensus because hearing oneself repeat a point of view one doesn&#x2019;t agree with has a way of opening one&#x2019;s mind. And it provides a great example of how community organizing works best when it&#x2019;s people-powered and resilient. This technique allows crowds of thousands to communicate, and also allows groups involved in direct street action to make democratic decisions on the fly.<br><br> The occupation zones are not just places to talk about a new society. They are becoming twenty-four-hour-a-day experiments in egalitarian living. Without paid staff or hierarchies, everyone gets fed, laundry gets done by the truckload, disagreements get facilitated, and those arrested are greeted by crowds of cheering supporters when they get out of jail.<br><br> Cynics might question the importance of this deepening sense of community. But people who have lived in a competitive, isolating world are tasting a way of life built on support and inclusion, in some cases for the first time. They are sharing the risk of police beatings, arrests, and pepper spray, and the hardship of sleepless nights in a rainy or snowy park. The resulting bonds create strength, solidarity, and resolve.

It includes such landmark essays as &#x201c;Punk as Propaganda,&#x201d; which explicates the self-packaging and media critique of The Ramones, Devo, the Sex Pistols, the Desperate Bicycles and others; &#x201c;Rock My Religion,&#x201d; in which Graham traces themes of ecstatic reverie in rock performance (with a focus on Patti Smith), through a beautiful composite of quotation, commentary and photography; and &#x201c;New Wave Rock and the Feminine,&#x201d; which discusses the onstage personae of Lydia Lunch, Debbie Harry and Siouxsie Sioux, and the gender politics of all-female groups such as The Slits, The Raincoats, Bush Tetras and others. Throughout <i>Rock/Music Writings</i>, Graham's appraisals are clear-eyed, sophisticated and poetically constructed, a genre of their own within artists' writings.</p><p></p><h2>From Craft to Profession: The Practice of Architecture in Nineteenth-Century America</h2><p>This is the first in-depth study of how the architectural profession emerged in early American history. Mary Woods dispels the prevailing notion that the profession developed under the leadership of men formally schooled in architecture as an art during the late nineteenth century. Instead, she cites several instances in the early 1800s of craftsmen-builders who shifted their identity to that of professional architects. While struggling to survive as designers and supervisors of construction projects, these men organized professional societies and worked for architectural education, appropriate compensation, and accreditation.<br><br>In such leading architectural practitioners as B. Henry Latrobe, Alexander J. Davis, H. H. Richardson, Louis Sullivan, and Stanford White, Woods sees collaborators, partners, merchandisers, educators, and lobbyists rather than inspired creators. She documents their contributions as well as those, far less familiar, of women architects and people of color in the profession's early days.<br><br>Woods's extensive research yields a remarkable range of archival materials: correspondence among carpenters; 200-year-old lawsuits; architect-client spats; the organization of craft guilds, apprenticeships, university programs, and correspondence schools; and the structure of architectural practices, labor unions, and the building industry. In presenting a more accurate composite of the architectural profession's history, Woods lays a foundation for reclaiming the profession's past and recasting its future. Her study will appeal not only to architects, but also to historians, sociologists, and readers with an interest in architecture's place in America today.</p><p><b>Mary N.

But in 1987, at the peak of his career, a long struggle with depression ended tragically for Wilmarth. The internationally acclaimed artist committed suicide at age 44, and his work largely fell from the public view.</p><br><p> Now, Wilmarth's legacy is recaptured in this beautifully written, richly illustrated book by art critic, historian, and poet Steven Henry Madoff. The first in-depth look at Wilmarth's extraordinary life as an artist, the book explores both the light and the darkness that underlie his work. Madoff offers a critical overview of the artist's career, examining the sculptor's response not only to historical masters such as C�zanne, Brancusi, Matisse, and Giacometti, but also to the art world of his times--particularly the dominant influence of Minimalism. Using the newly created Wilmarth archive at Harvard University's Fogg Art Museum, Madoff anchors this moving interpretation with the sculptor's own writings unearthed from journals, student notebooks, artist sketchbooks, and letters.</p><br><p> Madoff draws as well from interviews, articles, and poems that Wilmarth published in his lifetime, along with the body of criticism covering Wilmarth's development over the years. Acclaimed biographer Nancy Milford contributes a poignant memoir of her years of friendship with the artist, and Fogg associate curator Edward Saywell offers a powerful selection of Wilmarth's writings. The sculptor's romantic outlook, his gorgeously light-infused art, and his dramatic decline into work of harrowing darkness are sensitively examined in a book that reintroduces Christopher Wilmarth's sculptures and graphics to the contemporary art audience.</p></p><p><p>"In this elegantly constructed book, Steven Henry Madoff combines a thoughtful consideration of Wilmarth's anguished life with a fine appreciation of the long-term trajectory and visual poetry of his work. Full of fascinating insights, it is a pleasure to read."<b>--Jack Flam, Brooklyn College and City University of New York Graduate Center.</b></p><p>"The volume will be an important addition to the literature on post-war American art. Written by someone who is both art critic and poet, Madoff's book contains many sensitive interpretations of Wilmarth's work."<b>--Bruce Altshuler, New York University</b></p><p>"This book will fill a significant void in the literature on recent American art.

The book introduces and develops three psychological and sociological themes. One is the idea that not only is psychology necessarily a social construction but that the mind itself is to some degree a social construction. The second them involves struggles over the existence and nature of consciousness. The third is the theme of psychology as an applied discipline. This book is appropriate for anyone who is interested in critically exploring the evolution of psychology from its origins to the present.</p><h2>Successful School Leadership: Planning, Politics, Performance, and Power (Peabody College Education Leadership Series)</h2><p><p>The introductory volume in the Peabody Educational Leadership Series, <i>Successful School Leadesrhip </i>provides readers with a solid overview of the primary topics that current and aspiring leaders will be faced with when making decisions regarding education organizations.

Includes chapters on computer security, multimedia operating systems, multiple processor systems, single processor computer systems, and a score of other topics. Also features a companion Web site. DLC: Operating systems.</p><p>For software development professionals and computer science students, <i>Modern Operating Systems</i> gives a solid conceptual overview of operating system design, including detailed case studies of Unix/Linux and Windows 2000.<p> What makes an operating system modern? According to author Andrew Tanenbaum, it is the awareness of high-demand computer applications--primarily in the areas of multimedia, parallel and distributed computing, and security. The development of faster and more advanced hardware has driven progress in software, including enhancements to the operating system. It is one thing to run an old operating system on current hardware, and another to effectively leverage current hardware to best serve modern software applications. If you don't believe it, install Windows 3.0 on a modern PC and try surfing the Internet or burning a CD.</p><p> Readers familiar with Tanenbaum's previous text, <i>Operating Systems</i>, know the author is a great proponent of simple design and hands-on experimentation. His earlier book came bundled with the source code for an operating system called Minux, a simple variant of Unix and the platform used by Linus Torvalds to develop Linux. Although this book does not come with any source code, he illustrates many of his points with code fragments (C, usually with Unix system calls).</p><p> The first half of <i>Modern Operating Systems</i> focuses on traditional operating systems concepts: processes, deadlocks, memory management, I/O, and file systems. There is nothing groundbreaking in these early chapters, but all topics are well covered, each including sections on current research and a set of student problems. It is enlightening to read Tanenbaum's explanations of the design decisions made by past operating systems gurus, including his view that additional research on the problem of deadlocks is impractical except for "keeping otherwise unemployed graph theorists off the streets."</p><p> It is the second half of the book that differentiates itself from older operating systems texts. Here, each chapter describes an element of what constitutes a modern operating system--awareness of multimedia applications, multiple processors, computer networks, and a high level of security. The chapter on multimedia functionality focuses on such features as handling massive files and providing video-on-demand. Included in the discussion on multiprocessor platforms are clustered computers and distributed computing. Finally, the importance of security is discussed--a lively enumeration of the scores of ways operating systems can be vulnerable to attack, from password security to computer viruses and Internet worms.</p><p> Included at the end of the book are case studies of two popular operating systems: Unix/Linux and Windows 2000. There is a bias toward the Unix/Linux approach, not surprising given the author's experience and academic bent, but this bias does not detract from Tanenbaum's analysis. Both operating systems are dissected, describing how each implements processes, file systems, memory management, and other operating system fundamentals. </p><p> Tanenbaum's mantra is simple, accessible operating system design. Given that modern operating systems have extensive features, he is forced to reconcile physical size with simplicity. Toward this end, he makes frequent references to the Frederick Brooks classic <i>The Mythical Man-Month</i> for wisdom on managing large, complex software development projects. He finds both Windows 2000 and Unix/Linux guilty of being too complicated--with a particular skewering of Windows 2000 and its "mammoth Win32 API." A primary culprit is the attempt to make operating systems more "user-friendly," which Tanenbaum views as an excuse for bloated code. The solution is to have smart people, the smallest possible team, and well-defined interactions between various operating systems components. Future operating system design will benefit if the advice in this book is taken to heart. <i>--Pete Ostenson</i></p>PREFACE <p> The world has changed a great deal since the first edition of this book appeared in 1992. Computer networks and distributed systems of all kinds have become very common. Small children now roam the Internet, where previously only computer professionals went. As a consequence, this book has changed a great deal, too. </p><p> The most obvious change is that the first edition was about half on single-processor operating systems and half on distributed systems. I chose that format in 1991 because few universities then had courses on distributed systems and whatever students learned about distributed systems had to be put into the operating systems course, for which this book was intended. Now most universities have a separate course on distributed systems, so it is not necessary to try to combine the two subjects into one course and one book. This book is intended for a first course on operating systems, and as such focuses mostly on traditional single-processor systems. </p><p> I have coauthored two other books on operating systems. This leads to two possible course sequences. </p><p> Practically-oriented sequence:</p><p>Operating Systems Design and Implementation by Tanenbaum and Woodhull Distributed Systems by Tanenbaum and Van Steen </p><p> Traditional sequence:</p><p>Modern Operating Systems by Tanenbaum Distributed Systems by Tanenbaum and Van Steen </p><p> The former sequence uses MINIX and the students are expected to experiment with MINIX in an accompanying laboratory supplementing the first course. The latter sequence does not use MINIX. Instead, some small simulators are available that can be used for student exercises during a first course using this book. These simulators can be found starting on the author's Web page: cs.vu.nl/~ast/ by clicking on Software and supplementary material for my books. </p><p> In addition to the major change of switching the emphasis to single-processor operating systems in this book, other major changes include the addition of entire chapters on computer security, multimedia operating systems, and Windows 2000, all important and timely topics. In addition, a new and unique chapter on operating system design has been added. </p><p> Another new feature is that many chapters now have a section on research about the topic of the chapter. This is intended to introduce the reader to modern work in processes, memory management, and so on. These sections have numerous references to the current research literature for the interested reader. In addition, Chapter 13 has many introductory and tutorial references. </p><p> Finally, numerous topics have been added to this book or heavily revised. These topics include: graphical user interfaces, multiprocessor operating systems, power management for laptops, trusted systems, viruses, network terminals, CDROM file systems, mutexes, RAID, soft timers, stable storage, fair-share scheduling, and new paging algorithms. Many new problems have been added and old ones updated. The total number of problems now exceeds 450. A solutions manual is available to professors using this book in a course. They can obtain a copy from their local Prentice Hall representative. In addition, over 250 new references to the current literature have been added to bring the book up to date. </p><p> Despite the removal of more than 400 pages of old material, the book has increased in size due to the large amount of new material added. While the book is still suitable for a one-semester or two-quarter course, it is probably too long for a one-quarter or one-trimester course at most universities. For this reason, the book has been designed in a modular way. Any course on operating systems should cover chapters 1 through 6. This is basic material that every student show know. </p><p> If additional time is available, additional chapters can be covered. Each of them assumes the reader has finished chapters 1 through 6, but Chaps. 7 through 12 are each self contained, so any desired subset can be used and in any order, depending on the interests of the instructor. In the author's opinion, Chaps. 7 through 12 are much more interesting than the earlier ones. Instructors should tell their students that they have to eat their broccoli before they can have the double chocolate fudge cake dessert. </p><p> I would like to thank the following people for their help in reviewing parts of the manuscript: Rida Bazzi, Riccardo Bettati, Felipe Cabrera, Richard Chapman, John Connely, John Dickinson, John Elliott, Deborah Frincke, Chandana Gamage, Robbert Geist, David Golds, Jim Griffioen, Gary Harkin, Frans Kaashoek, Mukkai Krishnamoorthy, Monica Lam, Jussi Leiwo, Herb Mayer, Kirk McKusick, Evi Nemeth, Bill Potvin, Prasant Shenoy, Thomas Skinner, Xian-He Sun, William Terry, Robbert Van Renesse, and Maarten van Steen.

Tanenbaum</p></p><h2>Plato&#39;s &#34;Laws&#34;: The Discovery of Being</h2><p>The <i>Laws</i> was Plato's last work, his longest, and one of his most difficult. In contrast to the <i>Republic,</i> which presents an abstract ideal not intended for any actual community, the <i>Laws</i> seems to provide practical guidelines for the establishment and maintenance of political order in the real world. With this book, the distinguished classicist Seth Benardete offers an insightful analysis and commentary on this rich and complex dialogue. Each of the chapters corresponds to one of the twelve books of the <i>Laws,</i> illuminating the major themes and arguments, which have to do with theology, the soul, justice, and education.<br><br>The Greek word for law, "nomos," also means musical tune. Bernardete shows how music&#x2014;in the broadest sense, including drama, epic poetry, and even puppetry&#x2014;mediates between reason and the city in Plato's philosophy of law. Most broadly, however, Benardete here uncovers the concealed ontological dimension of the <i>Laws,</i> explaining why it is concealed and how it comes to light. In establishing the coherence and underlying organization of Plato's last dialogue, Benardete makes a significant contribution to Platonic studies.</p><p><b>Seth Benardete</b> is a professor of classics at New York University. His many books include <i>The Argument of the Action</i>, published by the Universoty of Chicago Press.Seth Benardete<br>Plato&#x2019;s Laws<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Plato&#x2019;s <i>Laws</i> is, in proportion to its size, the most neglected of his works. It is dauntingly massive and complex, but it must contain Plato&#x2019;s final views on a large range of issues, political social, ethical, metaphysical, and especially religious. Benardete brought to the task the skills of a classicist, a synoptic vision of Plato&#x2019;s goals and methodology, and a lifetime of writing challenging books on many of the other dialogues. Of the remarkably original ideas in his work, we may note at the start Benardete&#x2019;s attention to the word &#x201c;<i>nomoi</i>,&#x201d; meaning both &#x201c;laws&#x201d; and &#x201c;songs&#x201d;; he shows that Plato plays with ambiguity, making music a pathway to the understanding of the legal structure of the state. Book ten of the <i>Laws<i> is often called &#x2018;Plato&#x2019;s Theology,&#x2019; and it deserves that title, but Benardete shows how all twelve books of the dialogue are permeated with Plato&#x2019;s theological understanding of being and the state.&#x201d;--<i>Religious Studies Review<i></i></i></i></i><i><i><i> (<i>Religious Studies Review</i>)</i></i></i></p><h2>Data Abstraction And Problem Solving With Java: Walls and Mirrors</h2><p><p><b></b> The second edition, in Java, of the classic Walls and Mirrors approach to programming designs solutions to problems using both data abstraction (the walls) and recursion (the Mirrors). <i>Data Abstraction and Problem Solving with Java: Walls and Mirrors, 2e</i> provides a focus on the important concepts of data abstraction and data structures in a way that beginning programmers find accessible.&nbsp; <b> </b>The first part of the book covers problem-solving techniques including a review of Java fundamentals, principles of programming and software engineering, recursion and data abstraction, and linked lists.&nbsp;Later chapters focus on problem solving with abstract data types including stacks, queues, algorithm efficiency and sorting, trees, and graphs.&nbsp;This edition contains enhanced material on OO implementation.&nbsp;<b>MARKET</b>: Readers searching for problem solving solutions through abstraction, algorithmic refinement, data structures and recursion.</p></p><p><p>Data Structures/Java</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Data Abstraction and Problem Solving with Java, 2/E</b></p> <p>Frank&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Carrano, <i>University of Rhode Island</i></p> <p>Janet&nbsp;Prichard, <i>Bryant University</i></p> <p>ISBN: 0321304284</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The Second Edition of <i>Data Abstraction and Problem Solving with Java: Walls and Mirrors</i>, presents fundamental problem-solving and object-oriented programming skills by focusing on data abstraction (the Walls) and recursion (the Mirrors). &nbsp;It is fully revised to use the latest version of the Java programming language (Java 5.0).

Practice is an essential part of preparing for a test and improving a test taker&#39;s chance of success. The best way to practice taking a test is by going through lots of practice test questions. If someone has never taken a practice test, then they are unprepared for the types of questions and answer choices that they will encounter on the official test. There is a tremendous advantage to someone taking the test that is already familiar with the questions and answer choices. Another advantage of taking practice tests is that you can assess your performance and see if you need to study and practice more, or if you&#39;re already prepared enough to achieve success on your test day. If you do well on the practice test, then you know you&#39;re prepared. If you struggle on the practice test, then you know you may still have more work to do to get prepared. Taking lots of practice tests helps ensure that you are not surprised or disappointed on your test day. Our 3 HESI Admission Assessment Practice Tests give you the opportunity to test your knowledge on a set of questions. You can know everything that is going to be covered on the test and it will not do you any good on test day if you have not had a chance to practice. Repetition is a key to success and using practice test questions allows you to reinforce your strengths and improve your weaknesses. Detailed answer explanations are also included for each question. It may sound obvious, but you have to know which questions you missed (and more importantly why you missed them) to be able to avoid making the same mistakes again when you take the real test.

Surprisingly, these prehistoric people are not Asian but Caucasoid&#x2015;tall, large-nosed and blond with thick beards and round eyes. What were these blond Caucasians doing in the heart of Asia? What language did they speak? Might they be related to a "lost tribe" known from later inscriptions? Few clues are offered by their pottery or tools, but their <em>clothes</em>&#x2015;woolens that rarely survive more than a few centuries&#x2015;have been preserved as brightly hued as the day they were woven. Elizabeth Wayland Barber describes these remarkable mummies and their clothing, and deduces their path to this remote, forbidding place. The result is a book like no other&#x2015;a fascinating unveiling of an ancient, exotic, nearly forgotten world. A finalist for the Kiriyama Pacific Rim Book Prize. Illustrated</p><p>The 2000-year-old mummies of �r�mchi, found in central Asia along the famed Silk Road trading route, are so well preserved as to show clearly that they seem to be of Caucasoid origin. Where did these people come from? Where did they go? You can find their pale-skinned, light-haired descendents among the people of the region, but the story of their presence in this forbidding land leaves more mysteries than it answers. Mass migrations during the Bronze Age scattered many peoples across Europe and Asia, and these startlingly lively-looking mummies may help answer some questions about this period of human history. Their intact, fantastically colored and patterned clothing captures much of author Elizabeth Wayland Barber's attention--she is an expert on prehistoric textiles. Her enthusiastic descriptions of the sewing skills of these migrant people, while focusing on details, lend an immediacy to this fascinating tale. Black-and-white as well as color photos, maps, and diagrams illustrate Barber's colorful tale of anthropology. <i>--Therese Littleton</i>Elizabeth Wayland Barber is the author of Women&#x2019;s Work, The Dancing Goddesses, and The Mummies of �r�mchi.

The book charts the entirety of Lozano&#x2019;s production in 1960s New York, from her raucous drawings and paintings depicting broken tools, genitalia, and other body parts to the final exhibition of her spectacular series of abstract &#x201c;Wave Paintings&#x201d; at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1970.<br> &nbsp;<br> Highly regarded at the time, Lozano is now perhaps best known for&nbsp;<i>Dropout Piece</i>&nbsp;(1970), a conceptual artwork and dramatic gesture with which she quit the art world. Shortly afterwards she announced she would have no further contact with other women. Her &#x201c;dropout&#x201d; and &#x201c;boycott of women&#x201d; lasted until her death, by which time she was all but forgotten. This book tackles head-on the challenges that Lozano poses to art history&#x2014;and especially to feminist art history&#x2014;attending to her failures as well as her successes, and arguing that through dead ends and impasses she struggled to forge an alternative mode of living. <i>Lee Lozano: Not Working</i>&nbsp;looks for the means to think about complex figures like Lozano whose radical, politically ambiguous gestures test our assumptions about feminism and the &#x201c;right way&#x201d; to live and work.</p><p>Lee Lozano&#x2019;s short, remarkable career in 1960s New York is re-examined&#x2014;connecting her painting with her deliberate act of &#x201c;not working&#x201d; as a commentary on the art world.<b>Jo Applin</b> teaches modern and contemporary art at the Courtauld Institute of Art, London, and is the author of <i>Eccentric Objects: Rethinking Sculpture in 1960s America</i> (Yale).<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Betty Crocker Party Cookbook</h2><p><p>This faithful reproduction of <i>Betty Crocker's Party Book</i> will be a treat for anyone who lived through the 1960s--or wished they had!

Castle worked with materials that were immediately available, including a wide range of ephemera advertisements, periodicals, and packaging that he manipulated with soot, sticks, string and improvised colors to create an elaborate and unmistakable representation of his world. Subjects range from the farms of Garden Valley and interiors of homes, to family members, household objects, and snippets of popular culture. Other works move beyond the documentary to include invented words and symbols, fantastical calendars, and books with cryptic pictorial narratives.<br><br>Since Castle&#x2019;s work first came to light in the 1950s, attention has focused primarily on the unusual circumstances of his life: Castle was born profoundly deaf, remained illiterate, and never acquired a conventional mode of communicating with others. He is often assumed to have lived a form of extreme isolation. This new volume seeks to move beyond such biography; the artworks themselves can be seen as windows&#x2019; on his world and unique life.<br><br><i>Untitled: The Art of James Castle</i> is on view at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, DC, September 26, 2014 February 1, 2015<br></p><p>Nicholas R.

This new edition has been revised and updated and in this fourth printing, errors have been ironed out. The first chapter provides a quick overview of concepts and results in measure-theoretic probability theory that are useful in statistics. The second chapter introduces some fundamental concepts in statistical decision theory and inference. Subsequent chapters contain detailed studies on some important topics: unbiased estimation, parametric estimation, nonparametric estimation, hypothesis testing, and confidence sets. A large number of exercises in each chapter provide not only practice problems for students, but also many additional results.</p></p><p><p></p> <p>This book consists of four hundred exercises in mathematical statistics and their solutions, over 95% of which are in the author's Mathematical Statistics, Second Edition (Springer, 2003). For students preparing for work on a Ph.D. degree in statistics and instructors of mathematical statistics courses, this useful book provides solutions to train students for their research ability in mathematical statistics and presents many additional results and examples that complement any text in mathematical statistics. To develop problem-solving skills, two solutions and/or notes of brief discussions accompany a few exercises. </p> <p></p> <p>The exercises are grouped into seven chapters with titles matching those in the author's Mathematical Statistics. On the other hand, the book is stand-alone because exercises and solutions are comprehensible independently of their source, and notation and terminology are explained in the front of the book. </p> <p></p> <p>Readers are assumed to have a good knowledge in advanced calculus. A course in real analysis or measure theory is highly recommended. If this book is used with a statistics textbook that does not include probability theory, then knowledge in measure-theoretic probability theory is required. </p> <p></p> <p>Jun Shao is Professor of Statistics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.</p><p>Jun Shao is Professor of Statistics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.</p></p><h2>What Your Fourth Grader Needs to Know: Fundamentals of a Good Fourth-Grade Education (The Core Knowledge)</h2><p>Grade by grade, these groundbreaking and successful books provide a solid foundation in the fundamentals of a good education for first to sixth graders.<br><br>B &amp; W photographs, linecuts, and maps throughout; two-color printing.</p><p>de, these groundbreaking and successful books provide a solid foundation in the fundamentals of a good education for first to sixth graders.<br><br>B &amp; W photographs, linecuts, and maps throughout; two-color printing.E.

Down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed to be no color in anything except the posters that were plastered everywhere."<p> The year is 1984; the scene is London, largest population center of Airstrip One.</p><p> Airstrip One is part of the vast political entity Oceania, which is eternally at war with one of two other vast entities, Eurasia and Eastasia. At any moment, depending upon current alignments, all existing records show either that Oceania has always been at war with Eurasia and allied with Eastasia, or that it has always been at war with Eastasia and allied with Eurasia. Winston Smith knows this, because his work at the Ministry of Truth involves the constant "correction" of such records. "'Who controls the past,' ran the Party slogan, 'controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.'"</p><p> In a grim city and a terrifying country, where Big Brother is always Watching You and the Thought Police can practically read your mind, Winston is a man in grave danger for the simple reason that his memory still functions. He knows the Party's official image of the world is a fluid fiction. He knows the Party controls the people by feeding them lies and narrowing their imaginations through a process of bewilderment and brutalization that alienates each individual from his fellows and deprives him of every liberating human pursuit from reasoned inquiry to sexual passion. Drawn into a forbidden love affair, Winston finds the courage to join a secret revolutionary organization called The Brotherhood, dedicated to the destruction of the Party. Together with his beloved Julia, he hazards his life in a deadly match against the powers that be.</p><p> <i>Newspeak</i>, <i>doublethink</i>, <i>thoughtcrime</i>--in <i>1984</i>, George Orwell created a whole vocabulary of words concerning totalitarian control that have since passed into our common vocabulary.

"It is winter," answered the swallow, "and the chill snow will soon be here. In Egypt the sun is warm" From his high vantage point, the glittering statue of the Happy Prince is the pride of city officials. But the Prince&#x2019;s sapphire eyes are filled with tears because of the suffering he sees below. Stuck fast on his pedestal, there is nothing the gem-encrusted statue can do to help relieve the poor, until a little swallow stops to rest at his feet. The Prince persuades the bird to be his messenger, and to pluck out and carry one precious jewel after another to those in need. In order to survive the winter, the swallow must fly to a warmer place, but his love for the now-shabby Prince compels him to stay despite the consequences. Time after time, the brave little bird does all that is asked, until both he and the Happy Prince have nothing left to give.

As Harm de Blij argues in <em>The Power of Place</em>, in crucial ways--from the uneven distribution of natural resources to the unequal availability of opportunity--geography continues to hold billions of people in its grip. We are all born into natural and cultural environments that shape what we become, individually and collectively. From our "mother tongue" to our father's faith, from medical risks to natural hazards, <em>where</em> we start our journey has much to do with our destiny. Hundreds of millions of farmers in the river basins of Asia and Africa, and tens of millions of shepherds in isolated mountain valleys from the Andes to Kashmir, all live their lives much as their distant ancestors did, remote from the forces of globalization. Incorporating a series of persuasive maps, De Blij describes the tremendously varied environments across the planet and shows how migrations between them are comparatively rare. De Blij also looks at the ways we are redefining place so as to make its power even more potent than it has been, with troubling implications.<br></p><p><br><strong>Harm de Blij</strong> is the John A.

Sachs, Director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University<p></p><br>"What Carl Sagan did for cosmology, Harm de Blij is doing for geography.

(New York Review Books Classics)</h2><p>James Schuyler's utterly original What's for Dinner? features a cast of characters who appear to have escaped from a Norman Rockwell painting to run amok. In tones that are variously droll, deadpan, and lyrical, Schuyler tells a story that revolves around three small-town American households. The Delehanteys are an old-fashioned Catholic family whose twin teenage boys are getting completely out of hand, no matter that their father is hardly one to spare the rod. Childless Norris and Lottie Taylor have been happily married for years, even as Lottie has been slowly drinking herself to death. Mag, a recent widow, is on the prowl for love. Retreating to an institution to dry out, Lottie finds herself caught up in a curious comedy of group therapy manners. At the same time, however, she begins an ascent from the depths of despair&#x2014;illuminated with the odd grace and humor that readers of Schuyler's masterful poetry know so well&#x2014;to a new understanding, that will turn her into an improbable redeemer within an unlikely world.<br><br><i>What's for Dinner?</i> is among the most delightful and unusual works of American literature. Charming and dark, off-kilter but pedestrian, mercurial yet matter-of-fact, Schuyler's novel is an alluring invention that captures both the fragility and the tenacity of ordinary life.</p><p>James Schuyler (1923&#x2013;1991) was a preeminent figure in the celebrated New York School of poets.

Was the American constitution designed to protect individual rights? To limit the powers of government? To curb the excesses of democracy? Or to create a robust democratic nation-state? These questions echo through today's most heated legal and political debates.<br> In this powerful new interpretation of America's origins, Max Edling argues that the Federalists were primarily concerned with building a government that could act vigorously in defense of American interests. The Constitution transferred the powers of war making and resource extraction from the states to the national government thereby creating a nation-state invested with all the important powers of Europe's eighteenth-century "fiscal-military states." A strong centralized government, however, challenged the American people's deeply ingrained distrust of unduly concentrated authority. To secure the Constitution's adoption the Federalists had to accommodate the formation of a powerful national government to the strong current of anti-statism in the American political tradition. They did so by designing a government that would be powerful in times of crisis, but which would make only limited demands on the citizenry and have a sharply restricted presence in society. The Constitution promised the American people the benefit of government without its costs.<br> Taking advantage of a newly published letterpress edition of the constitutional debates, <em>A Revolution in Favor of Government</em> recovers a neglected strand of the Federalist argument, making a persuasive case for rethinking the formation of the federal American state.<br></p><p>Max M. Edling is at Cornell University.<br>"An important work on the origins of the U.S. Constitution. --<em>New Perspectives on the Eighteenth Century</em><p></p><br>"A book of undoubted power and value..."--<em>The Journal of American History</em><p></p><br>"At the very least, Max M. Edling has written the most important book on the adoption of the United States Constitution to appear since Forrest McDonald refuted Charles Beard in <em>We the People: The Economic Origins of the Constitution</em> (1958)."--<em>Journal of the Early American Republic</em><p></p><br>"This modest-sized book makes a large argument, and one that's certain to reopen historical debate over the federal Constitution and the ratification debates of 1787-88.... <em>A Revolution in Favor of Government</em> is based on a fresh reading of extensive sources, succinctly summarizes relevant information that's often unfamiliar, and puts American history in a comparative context. Although Edling presents his argument with scrupulous clarity, the book is not light reading. Readers are, however, rewarded for their efforts with a more profound understanding of the peculiar American system of government that emerged from the struggles and debates of the 1780s and an explanation why it is we keep returning of the writings of the time."--<em>Business History Review</em><p></p><br>"...the scholarship is deeply impressive and the argument is an important contribution. It will certainly repay the efforts of every scholar in the field."--<em>American Historical Review</em><p></p><br>"Edling's book is a powerfully argued revisionist interpretation of the origins of the Constitution. More than anything else, it helps us better understand the constitutional sources of the gigantic fiscal-military state that the United States has become."--Gordon S. Wood, Alva O. Way University Professor and Professor of History, Brown University<p></p><br>"Max M. Edling's exciting new book is a breath of fresh air in an agenda-driven and highly politicized historical literature that has lost touch with historical reality. The state-building paradigm enables Edling to bring history back in, both through comparative analysis of developments elsewhere and by reconstructing the broader geopolitical context within which the American federalstate operated. <em>A Revolution in Favor of Government</em> is an impressive achievement."--Peter Onuf, Thomas Jefferson Foundation Professor of History, University of Virginia<p></p><br>"Certain to be controversial, this major and timely work alters the terms of discussion about the Framers' intentions in writing the Constitution and about the kind of government they sought to establish. Everyone interested in the subject will have to contend with Edling's arguments, which challenge over 30 years of widely accepted scholarship."--James M. Banner, Jr., Washington, DC<p></p><br>"Not only a pleasure to read but extremely informative and persuasively argued. I will never think about the US Constitution in the old way again." --Daniel W. Howe, Rhodes Professor of American History, Emeritus, Oxford University<p></p><br>"A short review cannot do justice to this well-crafted, readable, and important work. It is enough to say that it raises issues that must be addressed by political scientists and historians. Highly recommended."--<em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"This is a remarkable book. Readers of it will never view the U.S. Constitution or the founding period in the same way again. It confronts the reader with a remarkably new and different perspective that the primary goal of the framers of the Constitution and its Federalist defenders was to create a strong fiscal-military state that could raise the revenue needed to survive military competition against other nations. The book is clearly written, well-organized, and serves the intended audience well. Garnering documentary support from a wide variety of Federalist and Anti-federalist thinkers, Edling thoroughly documents and supports every step in his argument."--<em>Law &amp; Politics Book Review</em><p></p><br>"I learned much from reading <em>A Revolution in Favor of Government</em>.

Making faith-based decisions is a sign of Christian maturity - both individually and corporately. With so many voices and opinions within a congregation or organization, it may seem an insurmountable challenge for church leaders to settle on a direction. If you&#39;re dissatisfied with asset-evaluation or strategic planning techniques and are ready for change, learn how to listen for God&#39;s voice as you ponder... * Who is God calling you to become as a community of faith?* Where is Christ&#39;s presence active among you?* Where is the Holy Spirit leading? &#34;The movement of the Holy Spirit is often unseen but felt like the wind,&#34; write the authors. &#34;Just as the wind moves hot air balloons, so the Holy Spirit can influence the process of movement in the church.

In the first book ever to deal simultaneously with Margaret Mitchell&#x2019;s beloved novel and David Selznick&#x2019;s spectacular film version of <i>Gone with the Wind</i>, film critic Molly Haskell seeks the answers. By all industry predictions, the film should never have worked. What makes it work so amazingly well are the fascinating and uncompromising personalities that Haskell dissects here: Margaret Mitchell, David Selznick, and Vivien Leigh. As a feminist and onetime Southern adolescent, Haskell understands how the story takes on different shades of meaning according to the age and eye of the beholder. She explores how it has kept its edge because of Margaret Mitchell&#x2019;s (and our) ambivalence about Scarlett and because of the complex racial and sexual attitudes embedded in a story that at one time or another has offended almost everyone.</p><p>Haskell imaginatively weaves together disparate strands, conducting her story as her own inner debate between enchantment and disenchantment. Sensitive to the ways in which history and cinema intersect, she reminds us why these characters, so riveting to Depression audiences, continue to fascinate 70 years later.</p></p><p><b>Molly Haskell</b> is a writer and film critic. She has lectured widely on the role of women in film and is the author of <i>From Reverence to Rape: The Treatment of Women in the Movies</i>. She lives in New York City.From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Dan Zak Why should we give a damn about "Gone With the Wind," a moss-covered cultural landmark long since rooted and constantly pruned in pop culture, academia and filmdom? Its 1,000-plus-page book version and 226-minute film version are too sprawling, too dredged, too sundry to address altogether, in a fresh and compelling way, in one fell swoop. Yet that is what critic Molly Haskell does in the 228 dense, driven pages of "Frankly, My Dear." The blazing orange sunset over the silhouetted hills of Tara is an image that calls to mind an epic story set to the soaring strains of Max Steiner's symphonic score. With this book, Haskell strips away the iconographic baggage of "GWTW," exposing the heat of the creative inferno behind those Technicolor backdrops. It's a task more daunting than wooing Ashley or keeping Rhett, but Haskell divides and conquers. She wrangles "GWTW" through an affectionate dressing-down of its three main creative forces: the neurotic, ambitious novelist Margaret Mitchell, the megalomaniacal producer David O. Selznick and the tornadic actress Vivien Leigh. Together these artists were a triumvirate of gumption. The scope of their outsize personalities was crucial to the outsize picture's success, and to exploring its particulars 70 years after the fact. "Frankly, My Dear" is many things at once -- blunt biography, poetic love letter, skeptical appraisal, backlot gossipmonger -- and only rarely feels scatterbrained. Haskell's five chapters have little to do with chronology and more to do with a careful overlaying of themes. In the penultimate chapter, "E Pluribus Unum," a title invoking battles for unity on both historical and cinematic fronts, Haskell concludes that "GWTW" holds together because of its opposing forces, its yins and yangs, its leading players and its unsung heroes. Its contradictions are its glue. North and South. Black and white. Vulgarity and refinement. Timeless truths and campy stereotypes. Miniaturist detail and grandiloquent sweep. The film is an "inimitable mixture of acerbic forthrightness and demure femininity," molded by bold, no-nonsense director Victor Fleming and polished by the man he replaced partway through the filming, George Cukor, who remained as counselor to Leigh and Olivia de Havilland after his dismissal. Selznick was the axis on which the production spun, yet Haskell says it's impossible to consider "GWTW" without the crucial contributions of "minor" players like production designer William Cameron Menzies (whose vision ensures that the film's "sprawling canvas . . . doesn't break into fragments") and actress Hattie McDaniel ("an abiding presence" in a roiling, anchorless story). Haskell's description of the production is the most delicious part of the book. Selznick wielded power on a diet of peanuts, bananas and Dexedrine. Ben Hecht, one of more than a dozen screenwriters, flew in for quick rewrites and fled on the verge of emotional collapse. Mitchell, riven with self-consciousness, quarantined herself from most of the production. Leigh, charged with bringing to life one of literature's most celebrated characters, swung between brilliance and madness. Haskell's triumph is articulating how a hulking masterpiece emerged from the messy interplay of the unlikeliest of players, how nervous breakdowns yielded a one-of-a-kind creative construction, how the forces of Mitchell, Selznick and Leigh churned into a perfect storm. Haskell's writing style, mostly eloquent, sometimes teeters between pedantic and playful, and her psychoanalysis sometimes prevails in places where fact-based reportage would've been more suitable and enlightening. An expert on women in film, Haskell considers the feminist angle of "GWTW" ("how unusual it was to create a heroine of such wicked proportions . . . and to refuse the consolations of a romantic ending") but is careful to give the men equal consideration, concluding that they are "wimps and weaklings" (even Rhett) when compared with Scarlett O'Hara, the "generalissima on the battlefield of courtship and marriage." "Frankly, My Dear" is heralded by its inside jacket flap as "the first book ever to deal simultaneously with Margaret Mitchell's beloved novel and David Selznick's spectacular film version," but it spends most of its time on the film and on Mitchell herself rather than on the mechanics of the novel. It's just as well. The story of "GWTW," while hugely successful on the page, moved past melodrama to psychodrama on its way to the screen. "Frankly, My Dear" demands to be followed by a viewing of the film in order to scrutinize the seams of the production, to catch the flashes of torrid madness between the gauzy close-ups and those Tara sunsets. <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

Achieving these aims as a practice manager demands a clear vision, sound preparation, planning and marshalling of resources, broad business knowledge, an understanding of a rapidly changing world, and above all wise judgement. So why Genghis Khan? Although some in the West see him in negative terms, the Mongol leader created one of the world&#39;s greatest empires. His hugely successful strategies included intelligence gathering, understanding his rivals&#39; motivations, being quick to learn and adopt new technologies and ideas, and successful people management. Genghis Khan is one of history&#39;s most charismatic and dynamic leaders - and you will need all his skill, strength and tenacity to succeed in both dentistry and business. This &#39;how to - &#39; book on survival and empire-building in the dentistry business is ideal for anyone who owns, aspires to own, or is involved in managing a practice. It contains advice relevant to both small and large practices, to dentists working in the National Health Service (NHS) and private practice, and to general and specialist practices. &#39;This book, in summoning years of valuable experience of the vagaries of dental practice and connecting them with the wider world, provides the reader with an excellent starting point from which to plan, develop and make successful their own practice.&#39; - Stephen Hancocks in his Foreword</p><p>I spent most of my dental career managing my own practice. This was not something I had been taught to do at dental school, but it was something I had to do, and do well, if my business was to prosper.This book is the culmination of those years, and of the ups and downs of managing a dental practice, which at times was not the easiest of jobs. It is not a self-indulgent text, but an honest insight into why a practice <i>must</i> be managed, then how to do it. It is about teamwork and about delivering the twin goals of high quality clinical care and outstanding customer care.This was my first attempt at writing a book (I had previously written many articles) and seeing my words in print and then for sale in a book shop gave me enormous satisfaction. I couldn't believe it when it won the Diagram Prize in 2011.The success of this book encouraged me to write a second, titled <i>How to be an&nbsp;effective&nbsp;expert witness</i>, which I am happy to say has enjoyed critical praise.Mike Young.&nbsp;<p> Michael F.D.

His works, of which Origins of Modern Japanese Literature is the only one previously translated into English, are the generic equivalent to what in America is called "theory." Karatani's writings are important not only for the insights they offer on the various topics under discussion, but also as an example of a distinctly non-Western critical intervention. In <i>Architecture as Metaphor</i>, Karatani detects a recurrent "will to architecture" that he argues is the foundation of all Western thinking, traversing architecture, philosophy, literature, linguistics, city planning, anthropology, political economics, psychoanalysis, and mathematics. In the three parts of the book, he analyzes the complex bonds between construction and deconstruction, thereby pointing to an alternative model of "secular criticism," but in the domain of philosophy rather than literary or cultural criticism. As Karatani claims in his introduction, because the will to architecture is practically nonoexistent in Japan, he must first assume a dual role: one that affirms the architectonic (by scrutinizing the suppressed function of form) and one that pushes formalism to its collapse (by invoking Kurt Godel's incompleteness theorem). His subsequent discussions trace a path through the work of Christopher Alexander, Jane Jacobs, Gilles Deleuze, and others. Finally, amidst the drive that motivates all formalization, he confronts an unbridgeable gap, an uncontrollable event encountered in the exchange with the other; thus his speculation turns toward global capital movement. While in the present volume he mainly analyzes familiar Western texts, it is precisely for this reason that his voice discloses a distance that will add a new dimension to our English-language discourse.</p></p><p>In Architecture as Metaphor, Karatani detects a recurrent &#34;will to architecture&#34; that he argues is the foundation of all Western thinking, traversing architecture, philosophy, literature, linguistics, city planning, anthropology, political economics, psychoanalysis, and mathematics.

Jung (1875&#x2013;1961) was a preeminent thinker of the modern era. In seeking to establish an interdisciplinary science of analytical psychology, he studied psychiatry, religion, mysticism, literature, physics, biology, education, and criminology. He introduced the concepts of extraversion and introversion, and terms such as complex, archetype, individuation, and the collective unconscious. He stressed the primacy of finding meaning in our lives.</p><p><i>The Quotable Jung</i> is the single most comprehensive collection of Jung quotations ever assembled. It is the essential introduction for anyone new to Jung and the Jungian tradition. It will also inspire those familiar with Jung to view him in an entirely new way. <i>The Quotable Jung</i> presents hundreds of the most representative selections from the vast array of Jung's books, essays, correspondence, lectures, seminars, and interviews, as well as the celebrated <i>Red Book</i>, in which Jung describes his own fearsome confrontation with the unconscious. Organized thematically, this collection covers such topics as the psyche, the symbolic life, dreams, the analytic process, good and evil, creativity, alchemical transformation, death and rebirth, the problem of the opposites, and more. The quotations are arranged so that the reader can follow the thread of Jung&#x2019;s thought on these topics while gaining an invaluable perspective on his writings as a whole.</p><p>Succinct and accessible, <i>The Quotable Jung</i> also features a preface by Judith Harris and a detailed chronology of Jung&#x2019;s life and work.<br></p><ul><li>The single most comprehensive collection of Jung quotations ever assembled</li><li>Features hundreds of quotes</li><li>Covers such topics as the psyche, dreams, good and evil, death and rebirth, and more</li><li>Includes a detailed chronology of Jung&#x2019;s life and work</li><li>Serves as the ideal introduction to Jung and the Jungian tradition</li></ul><p></p></p><p><p>"An ideal resource for anyone seeking to find Jung's most fertile ideas succinctly and powerfully stated."<b>--John Beebe, author of <i>Integrity in Depth</i></b></p><p>"This comprehensive selection of quotations provides a pathway into the complex world of Jung's thought while never reducing his ideas to oversimplified formulas. <i>The Quotable Jung</i> is an extremely useful volume for anyone coming to Jung for the first time."<b>--Paul Bishop, author of <i>Reading Goethe at Midlife: Ancient Wisdom, German Classicism, and Jung</i></b></p><p>"Brings all of Jung's ideas together in brilliant form. . . .

Historian Iryna Vushko examines the interactions between these German-speaking bureaucrats and the local Galician population of Poles, Ukrainians, and Jews.

Until the unprecedented events of the recent global financial crisis economists often seemed unconcerned with this question, even suggesting that "greed is good." A closer look, however, suggests that greed and lust are generally considered good only for men, and then only outside the realm of family life. The history of Western economic ideas shows that men have given themselves more cultural permission than women for the pursuit of both economic and sexual self-interest. Feminists have long contested the boundaries of this permission, demanding more than mere freedom to act more like men. Women have gradually gained the power to revise our conceptual and moral maps and to insist on a better-and less gendered-balance between self interest and care for others. <br><br>This book brings women's work, their sexuality, and their ideas into the center of the dialectic between economic history and the history of economic ideas. It describes a spiralling process of economic and cultural change in Great Britain, France, and the United States since the 18th century that shaped the evolution of patriarchal capitalism and the larger relationship between production and reproduction. This feminist reinterpretation of our past holds profound implications for today's efforts to develop a more humane and sustainable form of capitalism.<br></p><p><br><strong>Nancy Folbre,</strong> Professor of Economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, has won international recognition for her research on the interface between feminist theory and political economy.

It focuses especially on the quest for gender equality, on the role of families in the reproduction of social inequalities, and on major inequities associated with an ageing population. Through comparative analysis he seeks to identify the kinds of welfare state reform that can optimize not only individuals' life chances but also collective welfare. The intellectual ambition is, in other words, to identify the mainsprings of a new and superior form of social equilibrium.</p> <p>This book will be of great interest to anyone concerned with gender and the changing role of women, with social and public policy, and with the future of the welfare state.</p></p><p>Gosta Esping-Andersen is Professor of Sociology at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona'An outstanding contribution to contemporary debates about the future direction of the welfare state in the advanced Western world...Esping-Andersen writes extremely lucidly and well and both his thesis and his recommendations are very plausible.

And last but not least, it is a surprisingly entertaining read.'<br> <i><b>European Sociological Review</b></i></p> <p>'Esping-Andersen's book confirms his position as one of the most brilliant social scientists of the last decades. His latest work is an invaluable contribution which helps to bridge the gap between demography, public policy and sociology, and provide a comprehensive frame of reference for understanding the potential revolutionary impact of the changing role of women.'<br> <i><b>Work, Employment and Society</b></i></p> <p>'A fascinating book. Esping-Andersen's contention that good policy reforms must begin with babies is provocative, imaginative and timely. A bold exposition of the unplanned consequences for family, fertility and ageing of the incomplete revolution of women's new roles.'<br> <b>Professor Jacqueline Scott, University of Cambridge</b></p> <p>'In this sweeping and provocative new book, Gosta Esping-Andersen brilliantly pulls together evidence from demography, economics, sociology, and child development to argue that the revolution in women&#x2019;s roles, if not addressed by reforms to the welfare state, will lead to increased inequality for current and future generations.'<br> <b>Jane Waldfogel, Columbia University</b></p></p><h2>Algebra: Form and Function</h2><p><p><i><b>This package includes a three-hole punched, loose-leaf edition of ISBN 9781118640784 and a registration code for the WileyPLUS course associated with the text.

King's call for racial justice and his faith in the power of nonviolence to engender a major transformation of American society is movingly conveyed in this authoritative multivolume series. <br><br>In <i>Volume IV</i>, with the Montgomery bus boycott at an end, King confronts the sudden demands of celebrity while trying to identify the next steps in the burgeoning struggle for equality. Anxious to duplicate the success of the boycott, he spends much of 1957 and 1958 establishing the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. But advancing the movement in the face of dogged resistance, he finds that it is easier to inspire supporters with his potent oratory than to organize a mass movement for social change. Yet King remains committed: "The vast possibilities of a nonviolent, non-cooperative approach to the solution of the race problem are still challenging indeed. I would like to remain a part of the unfolding development of this approach for a few more years." <br><br>King's budding international prestige is affirmed in March 1957, when he attends the independence ceremonies in Ghana, West Africa. Two months later his first national address, at the "Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom," is widely praised, and in June 1958, King's increasing prominence is recognized with a long-overdue White House meeting. During this period King also cultivates alliances with the labor and pacifist movements, and international anticolonial organizations. As <i>Volume IV</i> closes, King is enjoying the acclaim that has greeted his first book, <i>Stride Toward Freedom</i>, only to suffer a near-fatal stabbing in New York City.</p><p>Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s work as a champion of civil rights was largely realized through his marvelous abilities as a speaker and writer. This fourth volume of the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Project chronicles his writings from the years 1957 and 1958 and highlights the end of the historic Montgomery bus boycott, King's trip to Ghana on the eve of its independence, his monumental "Pilgrimage for Freedom" address, and his "Advice for Living" column for <i>Ebony</i> magazine. It also details the creation of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, King's White House meeting with President Eisenhower, and the release of his first book, <i>Stride Toward Freedom: The Montgomery Story</i>. Edited by Clayborne Carson, director of the project at Stanford University, the writings were culled from 6,000 documents, including speeches, sermons, correspondence, published writings, and unpublished manuscripts.<p> Along with their historical significance, these writings reveal the human side of King as well. In a sermon delivered in Birmingham, Alabama, around the time of several bombings in black neighborhoods, a crestfallen King asked a haunting question: "Where is God while hundreds and thousands of his children suffer merely because they are desirous of having freedom and human dignity?" In his acceptance speech for the NAACP Spingarn Medal in Detroit, he proclaimed, "This is a great time to be alive in America. We stand today on the threshold of the most constructive period of our nation's history.... It is one of the ironies of present history that the Negro, in his struggle for freedom, is no longer struggling for himself alone, but he is really struggling to save America." In a letter, he cites Gandhi and Henry David Thoreau as intellectual influences. There are also interesting correspondences between King and Harry Belafonte, Elijah Muhammad, C.L.R. James, Eleanor Roosevelt, and many others, making this an excellent reference work to this complex warrior for peace. <i>--Eugene Holley Jr.</i></p><b>Clayborne Carson</b> is Director and Senior Editor of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project.

The division was formed on Guadalcanal in September 1944, its ranks filled with battle-hardened veterans and untested replacement troops. The Sixth Division fought its only action on the island of Okinawa from April to June 1945 but entered the fight with more combat experience overall than any other Marine division in its initial battle. It disappointed no one. The Okinawa campaign involved eight Army and Marine divisions, but the Sixth captured most of the ground in some of the bloodiest fighting of the war. Weeks later, atomic attacks on two Japanese cities in early August 1945 swiftly ended the war. "Before Hiroshima there was Okinawa. Because of Okinawa, in considerable part there was Hiroshima," wrote one reporter. With the invasion of Japan canceled, the Sixth Division went to China on occupation duty and, on 1 April 1946, was reorganized out of existence. As it was created overseas, so was it disbanded. <br><br>This book tells the story of these Marines in their own words. Historian Laura Lacey - a Marine family member who has lived on Okinawa -sympathetically portrays the men who in 1945 fought a tremendous battle that she contends has not received its full share of attention from historians. Lacey considers the gritty details of close quarters combat and considers the myriad physical and psychological wounds that war wreaks. With Marines now engaged in a tough fight in Iraq, Lacey&#x2019;s book reminds us that whether or not a war is popular, war is indeed hell.</p><p>Laura Homan Lacey is the historian of the Sixth Marine Division and U.S. representative of the Battle of Okinawa Museum.

The tale of Dorian Gray&#x2019;s moral disintegration caused a scandal when it first appeared in 1890, but though Wilde was attacked for the novel&#x2019;s corrupting influence, he responded that there is, in fact, &#x201c;a terrible moral in <i>Dorian Gray</i>.&#x201d; Just a few years later, the book and the aesthetic/moral dilemma it presented became issues in the trials occasioned by Wilde&#x2019;s homosexual liaisons, which resulted in his imprisonment. Of Dorian Gray&#x2019;s relationship to autobiography, Wilde noted in a letter, &#x201c;Basil Hallward is what I think I am: Lord Henry what the world thinks me: Dorian what I would like to be&#x2014;in other ages, perhaps.&#x201d;</p><p>A lush, cautionary tale of a life of vileness and deception or a loving portrait of the aesthetic impulse run rampant? Why not both? After Basil Hallward paints a beautiful, young man's portrait, his subject's frivolous wish that the picture change and he remain the same comes true. Dorian Gray's picture grows aged and corrupt while he continues to appear fresh and innocent. After he kills a young woman, "as surely as if I had cut her little throat with a knife," Dorian Gray is surprised to find no difference in his vision or surroundings. "The roses are not less lovely for all that. The birds sing just as happily in my garden." <p> As Hallward tries to make sense of his creation, his epigram-happy friend Lord Henry Wotton encourages Dorian in his sensual quest with any number of Wildean paradoxes, including the delightful "When we are happy we are always good, but when we are good we are not always happy." But despite its many languorous pleasures, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> is an imperfect work. Compared to the two (voyeuristic) older men, Dorian is a bore, and his search for ever new sensations far less fun than the novel's drawing-room discussions. Even more oddly, the moral message of the novel contradicts many of Wilde's supposed aims, not least "no artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style." Nonetheless, the glamour boy gets his just deserts. And Wilde, defending Dorian Gray, had it both ways: "All excess, as well as all renunciation, brings its own punishment."</p>Oscar Wilde's only published full length novel, is the story of a man who sells his soul for eternal youth. In exchange, what does he give up and what does he gain? This novel, by Wilde is a wonderful soul-searching example of the cost of paradise, and the price of a wish. <p>Read by actor, comedian, novelist, journalist, screenwriter Stephen Fry, Dorian Gray's dilemma comes alive. He has also acted in a variety of films including A Fish Called Wanda, Peter's Friends, and The Wind in the Willows.</p></p><h2>Introductory Chemistry: A Foundation</h2><p>INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY: A FOUNDATION combines enhanced problem-solving structure with substantial pedagogy to enable students to become strong independent problem solvers in the introductory course and beyond.

By removing himself from the distractions of materialism, Thoreau hoped to not only improve his spiritual life but also gain a better understanding of society through solitary introspection.</p><p>In <i>Walden</i>, Thoreau condenses his two-year, two-month, two-day stay into a single year, using the four seasons to symbolize human development&#x2014;a cycle of life shared by both nature and man.

In addition to his support of outdoor recreation and conservation, Thoreau made lasting political contributions as a lifelong abolitionist and through his philosophy of civil disobedience, which would serve as a foundation for leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. Thoreau died at the age of forty-four, a result of much-weakened health after years of complications from tuberculosis. His writings, comprising more than twenty volumes, have been credited with influencing not only a multitude of writers, such as novelist Willa Cather and naturalist John Muir, but also the civil rights movement and the creation of the national park system.</p></p><h2>Introduction to Ecumenism</h2><p>Here is a comprehensive introduction to the spirituality and theology of the ecumenical movement as a whole, with an emphasis on the place of the Catholic Church, particularly the Catholic Church in the United States, within it.

It has been called on many occasions, &#x201c;the gold st- dard&#x201d; against which all other clinical research is measured. Although many clinical trials are of high quality, a careful reader of the medical literature will notice that a large number have deficiencies in design, conduct, analysis, presentation, and/or interpretation of results. Improvements have occurred over the past few decades, but too many trials are still conducted without adequate attention to its fundamental principles. Certainly, numerous studies could have been upgraded if the authors had had a better understanding of the fundamentals. Since the publication of the first edition of this book, a large number of other texts on clinical trials have appeared, most of which are indicated here [2&#x2013;21]. Several of them, however, discuss only specific issues involved in clinical trials. Additionally, many are no longer current. The purpose of this fourth edition is to update areas in which major progress has been made since the publication of the third edition. We have revised most chapters considerably and added one on ethical issues.</p><p>This is the fourth edition of a very successful textbook on clinical trials methodology, written by three recognized experts who have long and extensive experience in all areas of clinical trials. Most chapters have been revised considerably from the third edition. A chapter on ethics has been added and topics such as noninferiority and adaptive designs now receive considerable discussion. There is much new material on adverse events, adherence, data monitoring, and issues in analysis. This book is intended for the clinical researcher who is interested in designing a clinical trial and developing a protocol. It is also of value to researchers and practitioners who must critically evaluate the literature of published clinical trials and assess the merits of each trial and the implications for the care and treatment of patients. The authors use numerous examples of published clinical trials from a variety of medical disciplines to illustrate the fundamentals. The text is organized sequentially from defining the question to trial closeout. One chapter is devoted to each of the critical areas to aid the clinical trial researcher. These areas include pre-specifying the scientific questions to be tested and appropriate outcome measures, determining the organizational structure, estimating an adequate sample size, specifying the randomization procedure, implementing the intervention and visit schedules for participant evaluation, establishing an interim data and safety monitoring plan, detailing the final analysis plan, and reporting the trial results according to the pre-specified objectives. Although a basic introductory statistics course is helpful in maximizing the benefit of this book, a researcher or practitioner with limited statistical background would still find most if not all the chapters understandable and helpful. While the technical material has been kept to a minimum, the statistician may still find the principles and fundamentals presented in this text useful. This book has been successfully used for teaching courses in clinical trial methodology.Lawrence M. Friedman is Marion Rice Kirkwood Professor at Stanford Law School.

In addressing the nature of the Revolution, Nellis suggests that the American Revolution and American political systems and principles are unique and much less suited for export than many Americans believe. </p></p><p><b>Eric Nellis</b> is an Emeritus Associate Professor in the Department of History at the University of British Columbia. <br>&#34;By extending his analysis to 1820, Nellis challenges both students and scholars to re-examine their assumptions about the American Revolution.&#34; - Elizabeth Mancke, University of Akron</p><h2>Maurice Prendergast: Art &amp; Design</h2><p>Used.
